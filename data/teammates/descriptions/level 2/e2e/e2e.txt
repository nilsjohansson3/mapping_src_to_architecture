The E2E (end-to-end) component is used to interact with the application as a whole with Web browsers. Its primary function is for E2E tests.
  - `Selenium (Java)` is used to automate E2E testing with actual Web browsers.
The E2E component has no knowledge of the internal workings of the application and can only interact either with Web browser (as a whole application) or REST API calls (for the back-end logic). Its primary function is for E2E tests.
