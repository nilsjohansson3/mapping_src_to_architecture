Package overview:

- **`common.util`**: Contains utility classes.
- **`common.exceptions`**: Contains custom exceptions.
- **`common.datatransfer`**: Contains data transfer objects.

`common.datatransfer` package contains lightweight "data transfer object" classes for transferring data among components. They can be combined in various ways to transfer structured data between components. Given below are three examples.

<puml src="diagrams/DataTransferClasses.puml"/>

1. `Test Driver` can use the `DataBundle` in this manner to send an arbitrary number of objects to be persisted in the database.
1. This structure can be used to transfer search results of a student or instructor or response comments.
1. This structure can be used to send results of a feedback session (e.g., when showing a feedback session report to an instructor).

Some of these classes are methodless (and thus more of a data structure rather than a class); these classes use public variables for data for easy access.
