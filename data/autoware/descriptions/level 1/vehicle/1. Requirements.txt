Goals:

- The Vehicle Interface component converts Autoware commands to a vehicle-specific format and converts vehicle status in a vehicle-specific format to Autoware messages.
- The interface between Autoware and the Vehicle component is abstracted and independent of hardware.
- The interface is extensible such that additional vehicle-specific commands can be easily added. For example, headlight control.

Non-goals:

- Accuracy of responses from the vehicle will not be defined, but example accuracy requirements from reference designs are provided as examples.
- Response speed will not be defined.
