The Control Component generates the control signal to which the Vehicle Component subscribes. The generated control signals are computed based on the reference trajectories from the Planning Component.

The Control Component consists of two modules. The `trajectory_follower` module generates a vehicle control command to follow the reference trajectory received from the planning module. The command includes, for example, the desired steering angle and target speed. The `vehicle_command_gate` is responsible for filtering the control command to prevent abnormal values and then sending it to the vehicle. This gate also allows switching between multiple sources such as the MRM (minimal risk maneuver) module or some remote control module, in addition to the trajectory follower.

The Autoware control system is designed as a platform for automated driving systems that can be compatible with a diverse range of vehicles.

The control process in Autoware uses general information (such as target acceleration and deceleration) and no vehicle-specific information (such as brake pressure) is used. Hence it can be adjusted independently of the vehicle's drive interface enabling easy integration or performance tuning.

Furthermore, significant differences that affect vehicle motion constraints, such as two-wheel steering or four-wheel steering, are addressed by switching the control vehicle model, achieving control specialized for each characteristic.

Autoware's control module outputs the necessary information to control the vehicle as a substitute for a human driver. For example, the control command from the control module looks like the following:

```msg
- Target steering angle
- Target steering torque
- Target speed
- Target acceleration
```

Note that vehicle-specific values such as pedal positions and low-level information such as individual wheel rotation speeds are excluded from the command.
