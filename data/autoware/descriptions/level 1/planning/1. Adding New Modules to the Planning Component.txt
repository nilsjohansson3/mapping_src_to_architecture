Users can augment or replace existing Planning functionalities with new modules. This approach is commonly used for extending features, allowing for the addition of capabilities absent in the desired ODD or simplification of existing features.

However, adding these functionalities requires well-organized module interfaces. As of November 2023, an ideal modular system is not fully established, presenting some limitations. For more information, please refer to the Reference Implementation section [Customize features in the current implementation](customize-features-in-the-current-implementation) and [the implementation documentation of Planning](https://autowarefoundation.github.io/autoware.universe/main/planning/how-to-enable-or-disable-planning-module).
