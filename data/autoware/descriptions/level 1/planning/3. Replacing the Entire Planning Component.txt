Organizations or research entities developing autonomous driving Planning systems might be interested in integrating their proprietary Planning solutions with Autoware's Perception or Control modules. This can be achieved by replacing the entire Planning system, following the robust and stable interfaces defined between components. It is important to note, however, that direct coordination with existing Planning modules might not be possible.
