There are different requirements for interfaces between driving in well-structured lanes and driving in a free-space area like a parking lot. For example, while Lane Driving can handle routes with map IDs, this is not appropriate for planning in free space. The mechanism that switches planning sub-components at the scenario level (Lane Driving, Parking, etc) enables a flexible design of the interface, however, it has a drawbacks of the reuse of modules across different scenarios.
