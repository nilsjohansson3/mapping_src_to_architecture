The point cloud map must be supplied as a file with the following requirements:

- The point cloud map must be projected on the same coordinate defined in `map_projection_loader` in order to be consistent with the lanelet2 map and other packages that converts between local and geodetic coordinates. For more information, please refer to [the readme of `map_projection_loader`](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.universe/tree/main/map/map_projection_loader/README.md).
- It must be in the [PCD (Point Cloud Data) file format](https://pointclouds.org/documentation/tutorials/pcd_file_format.html), but can be a single PCD file or divided into multiple PCD files.
- Each point in the map must contain X, Y, and Z coordinates.
- An intensity or RGB value for each point may be optionally included.
- It must cover the entire operational area of the vehicle. It is also recommended to include an additional buffer zone according to the detection range of sensors attached to the vehicle.
- Its resolution should be at least 0.2 m to yield reliable localization results.
- It can be in either local or global coordinates, but must be in global coordinates (georeferenced) to use GNSS data for localization.

For more details on divided map format, please refer to [the readme of `map_loader` in Autoware Universe](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.universe/blob/main/map/map_loader/README.md).

!!! note

    Three global coordinate systems are currently supported by Autoware, including [Military Grid Reference System (MGRS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_Grid_Reference_System), [Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Transverse_Mercator_coordinate_system), and [Japan Rectangular Coordinate System](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%B9%B3%E9%9D%A2%E7%9B%B4%E8%A7%92%E5%BA%A7%E6%A8%99%E7%B3%BB).
    However, MGRS is a preferred coordinate system for georeferenced maps.
    In a map with MGRS coordinate system, the X and Y coordinates of each point represent the point's location within the 100,000-meter square, while the Z coordinate represents the point's elevation.
