Autoware relies on high-definition point cloud maps and vector maps of the driving environment to perform various tasks such as localization, route planning, traffic light detection, and predicting the trajectories of pedestrians and other vehicles.

This document describes the design of map component of Autoware, including its requirements, architecture design, features, data formats, and interface to distribute map information to the rest of autonomous driving stack.
