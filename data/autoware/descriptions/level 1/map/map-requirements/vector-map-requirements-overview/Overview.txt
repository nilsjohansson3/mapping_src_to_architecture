Autoware relies on high-definition point cloud maps and vector maps of the driving environment to perform various tasks such as localization, route planning, traffic light detection, and predicting the trajectories of pedestrians and other vehicles.

A vector map contains highly accurate information about a road network, lane geometry, and traffic lights. It is required for route planning, traffic light detection, and predicting the trajectories of other vehicles and pedestrians.

Vector Map uses [lanelet2_extension](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware_lanelet2_extension/blob/main/autoware_lanelet2_extension/docs/lanelet2_format_extension.md), which is based on the [lanelet2](https://github.com/fzi-forschungszentrum-informatik/Lanelet2) format and extended for Autoware.

The primitives (basic components) used in Vector Map are explained in [Web.Auto Docs - What is Lanelet2](https://docs.web.auto/en/user-manuals/vector-map-builder/introductionwhat-is-lanelet2). The following **Vector Map creation requirement specifications** are written on the premise of these knowledge.

This specification is a set of requirements for the creation of Vector Map(s) to ensure that Autoware drives safely and autonomously as intended by the user. To Create a Lanelet2 format .osm file, please refer to [Creating a vector map](https://autowarefoundation.github.io/autoware-documentation/latest/how-to-guides/integrating-autoware/creating-maps/creating-a-vector-map).
