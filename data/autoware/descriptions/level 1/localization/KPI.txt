To maintain sufficient pose estimation performance for safe operation, the following metrics are considered:

- Safety
  - The distance traveled within the ODD where pose estimation met the required accuracy, divided by the overall distance traveled within the ODD, as a percentage.
  - The anomaly detection rate for situations where the localization module cannot estimate pose within the ODD
  - The accuracy of detecting when the vehicle goes outside of the ODD, as a percentage.
- Computational load
- Latency
