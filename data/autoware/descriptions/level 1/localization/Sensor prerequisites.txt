- Input data is not defective.
  - Internal sensor observation such as IMU continuously keeps the proper frequency.
- Input data has correct and exact time stamps.
  - Estimated poses can be inaccurate or unstable if the timestamps are not exact.
- Sensors are correctly mounted with exact positioning and accessible from TF.
  - If the sensor positions are inaccurate, estimation results may be incorrect or unstable.
  - A sensor calibration framework is required to properly obtain the sensor positions.
