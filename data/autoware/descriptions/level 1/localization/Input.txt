- Sensor message
  - e.g., LiDAR, camera, GNSS, IMU, CAN Bus, etc.
  - Data types should be ROS primitives for reusability
- Map data
  - e.g., point cloud map, lanelet2 map, feature map, etc.
  - The map format should be chosen based on use case and sensor configuration
  - Note that map data is not required for some specific cases (e.g., GNSS-only localization)
- tf, static_tf
  - map frame
  - base_link frame
