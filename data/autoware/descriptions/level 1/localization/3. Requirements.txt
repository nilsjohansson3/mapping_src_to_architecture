- By implementing different modules, various sensor configurations and algorithms can be used.
- The localization system can start pose estimation from an ambiguous initial location.
- The system can produce a reliable initial location estimation.
- The system can manage the state of the initial location estimation (uninitialized, initializable, or non-initializable) and can report to the error monitor.
