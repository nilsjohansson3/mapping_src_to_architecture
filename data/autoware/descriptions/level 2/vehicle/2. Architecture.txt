The Vehicle Interface component consists of the following components:

- A Raw Vehicle Command Converter component that will pass through vehicle commands from the Control component if velocity/acceleration control is supported by the drive-by-wire system. Otherwise, the Control commands will be modified according to the control method (eg: converting a target acceleration from the Control component to a vehicle specific accel/brake pedal value through the use of an acceleration map)
- A Vehicle Interface component (vehicle specific) that acts as an interface between Autoware and a vehicle to communicate control signals and to obtain information about the vehicle (steer output, tyre angle etc)

Each component contains static nodes of Autoware, while each module can be dynamically loaded and unloaded (corresponding to C++ classes). The mechanism of the Vehicle Interface component is depicted by the following figures:
