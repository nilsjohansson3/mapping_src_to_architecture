Update the offsets by RLS in four grids around newly obtained data. By considering linear interpolation, the update takes into account appropriate weights. Therefore, there is no need to remove data by thresholding.

**Advantage** : No data is wasted because updates are performed on the 4 grids around the data with appropriate weighting.
**Disadvantage** : Accuracy may be degraded due to extreme bias of the data. For example, if data $z(k)$ is biased near $Z_{RR}$ in Fig. 2, updating is performed at the four surrounding points ( $Z_{RR}$, $Z_{RL}$, $Z_{LR}$, and $Z_{LL}$), but accuracy at $Z_{LL}$ is not expected.
