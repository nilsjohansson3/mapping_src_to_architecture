After launching Autoware, run the `autoware_accel_brake_map_calibrator` by the following command and then perform autonomous driving. Note: You can collect data with manual driving if it is possible to use the same vehicle interface as during autonomous driving (e.g. using a joystick).

```sh
ros2 launch autoware_accel_brake_map_calibrator accel_brake_map_calibrator.launch.xml rviz:=true
```

Or if you want to use rosbag files, run the following commands.

```sh
ros2 launch autoware_accel_brake_map_calibrator accel_brake_map_calibrator.launch.xml rviz:=true use_sim_time:=true
ros2 bag play <rosbag_file> --clock
```

During the calibration with setting the parameter `progress_file_output` to true, the log file is output in [directory of *autoware_accel_brake_map_calibrator*]/config/ . You can also see accel and brake maps in [directory of *autoware_accel_brake_map_calibrator*]/config/accel_map.csv and [directory of *autoware_accel_brake_map_calibrator*]/config/brake_map.csv after calibration.
