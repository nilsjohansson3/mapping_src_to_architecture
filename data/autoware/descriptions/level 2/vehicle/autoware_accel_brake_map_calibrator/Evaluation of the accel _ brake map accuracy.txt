The accuracy of map is evaluated by the **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** between the observed acceleration and predicted acceleration.

**TERMS:**

- `Observed acceleration`: the current vehicle acceleration which is calculated as a derivative value of the wheel speed.

- `Predicted acceleration`: the output of the original accel/brake map, which the Autoware is expecting. The value is calculated using the current pedal and velocity.

You can check additional error information with the following topics.

- `/accel_brake_map_calibrator/output/current_map_error` : The error of the original map set in the `csv_path_accel/brake_map` path. The original map is not accurate if this value is large.
- `/accel_brake_map_calibrator/output/updated_map_error` : The error of the map calibrated in this node. The calibration quality is low if this value is large.
- `/accel_brake_map_calibrator/output/map_error_ratio` : The error ratio between the original map and updated map (ratio = updated / current). If this value is less than 1, it is desirable to update the map.
