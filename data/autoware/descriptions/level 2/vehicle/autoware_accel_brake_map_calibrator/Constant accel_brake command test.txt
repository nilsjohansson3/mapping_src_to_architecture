These scripts are useful to test for accel brake map calibration. These generate an `ActuationCmd` with a constant accel/brake value given interactively by a user through CLI.

- accel_tester.py
- brake_tester.py
- actuation_cmd_publisher.py

The `accel/brake_tester.py` receives a target accel/brake command from CLI. It sends a target value to `actuation_cmd_publisher.py` which generates the `ActuationCmd`. You can run these scripts by the following commands in the different terminals, and it will be as in the screenshot below.

```bash
ros2 run autoware_accel_brake_map_calibrator accel_tester.py
ros2 run autoware_accel_brake_map_calibrator brake_tester.py
ros2 run autoware_accel_brake_map_calibrator actuation_cmd_publisher.py
```
