The `accel brake map_calibrator` publishes diagnostics message depending on the calibration status.
Diagnostic type `WARN` indicates that the current accel/brake map is estimated to be inaccurate. In this situation, it is strongly recommended to perform a re-calibration of the accel/brake map.

| Status                  | Diagnostics Type | Diagnostics message                        | Description                                         |
| ----------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| No calibration required | `OK`             | "OK"                                       |                                                     |
| Calibration Required    | `WARN`           | "Accel/brake map Calibration is required." | The accuracy of current accel/brake map may be low. |

This diagnostics status can be also checked on the following ROS topic.

```sh
ros2 topic echo /accel_brake_map_calibrator/output/update_suggest
```

When the diagnostics type is `WARN`, `True` is published on this topic and the update of the accel/brake map is suggested.
