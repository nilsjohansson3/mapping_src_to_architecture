The core of the converter's functionality lies in its use of a CSV-formatted lookup table. This table encapsulates the relationship between the throttle/brake pedal (depending on your vehicle control interface) and the corresponding vehicle acceleration across various speeds. The converter utilizes this data to accurately translate target accelerations into appropriate throttle/brake values.
