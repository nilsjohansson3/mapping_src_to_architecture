Reference data for the lookup table is generated through the following steps:

1. **Data Collection**: On a flat road, a constant value command (e.g., throttle/brake pedal) is applied to accelerate or decelerate the vehicle.
2. **Recording Data**: During this phase, both the IMU acceleration and vehicle velocity data are recorded.
3. **CSV File Generation**: A CSV file is created, detailing the relationship between command values, vehicle speed, and resulting acceleration.

Once the acceleration map is crafted, it should be loaded when the RawVehicleCmdConverter node is launched, with the file path defined in the launch file.
