`autoware_map_projection_loader` is responsible for publishing `map_projector_info` that defines in which kind of coordinate Autoware is operating.
This is necessary information especially when you want to convert from global (geoid) to local coordinate or the other way around.

- If `map_projector_info_path` DOES exist, this node loads it and publishes the map projection information accordingly.
- If `map_projector_info_path` does NOT exist, the node assumes that you are using the `MGRS` projection type, and loads the lanelet2 map instead to extract the MGRS grid.
  - **DEPRECATED WARNING: This interface that uses the lanelet2 map is not recommended. Please prepare the YAML file instead.**
