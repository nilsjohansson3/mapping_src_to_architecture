- **To Sensing**
  - Projection information: Used to convert GNSS data from geodetic coordinate system to local coordinate system
- **To Localization**
  - Point cloud map: Used for LiDAR-based localization
  - Vector map: Used for localization methods based on road markings, etc
- **To Perception**
  - Point cloud map: Used for obstacle segmentation by comparing LiDAR and point cloud map
  - Vector map: Used for vehicle trajectory prediction
- **To Planning**
  - Vector map: Used for behavior planning
- **To API layer**
  - Projection information: Used to convert localization results from local coordinate system to geodetic coordinate system
