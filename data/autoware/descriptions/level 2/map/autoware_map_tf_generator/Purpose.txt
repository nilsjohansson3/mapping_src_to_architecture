The nodes in this package broadcast the `viewer` frame for visualization of the map in RViz.

Note that there is no module to need the `viewer` frame and this is used only for visualization.

The following are the supported methods to calculate the position of the `viewer` frame:

- `pcd_map_tf_generator_node` outputs the geometric center of all points in the PCD.
- `vector_map_tf_generator_node` outputs the geometric center of all points in the point layer.
