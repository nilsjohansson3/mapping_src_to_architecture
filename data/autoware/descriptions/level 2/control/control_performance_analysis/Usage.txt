- After launched simulation and control module, launch the `control_performance_analysis.launch.xml`.
- You should be able to see the driving monitor and error variables in topics.
- If you want to visualize the results, you can use `Plotjuggler` and use `config/controller_monitor.xml` as layout.
- After import the layout, please specify the topics that are listed below.

> - /localization/kinematic_state
> - /vehicle/status/steering_status
> - /control_performance/driving_status
> - /control_performance/performance_vars

- In `Plotjuggler` you can export the statistic (max, min, average) values as csv file. Use that statistics to compare the control modules.
