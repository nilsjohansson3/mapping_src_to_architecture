`control_performance_analysis` is the package to analyze the tracking performance of a control module and monitor the driving status of the vehicle.

This package is used as a tool to quantify the results of the control module.
That's why it doesn't interfere with the core logic of autonomous driving.

Based on the various input from planning, control, and vehicle, it publishes the result of analysis as `control_performance_analysis::msg::ErrorStamped` defined in this package.

All results in `ErrorStamped` message are calculated in Frenet Frame of curve. Errors and velocity errors are calculated by using paper below.

If you are interested in calculations, you can see the error and error velocity calculations in section `C. Asymptotical Trajectory Tracking With Orientation Control`.

Error acceleration calculations are made based on the velocity calculations above. You can see below the calculation of error acceleration.
