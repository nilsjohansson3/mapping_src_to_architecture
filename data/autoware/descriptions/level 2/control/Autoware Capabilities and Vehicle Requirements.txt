As an alternative to human driving, autonomous driving systems essentially aim to handle tasks that humans can perform. This includes not only controlling the steering wheel, accel, and brake, but also automatically detecting issues such as poor brake response or a misaligned steering angle. However, this is a trade-off, as better vehicle performance will lead to superior system behavior, ultimately affecting the design of ODD.

On the other hand, for tasks that are not typically anticipated or cannot be handled by a human driver, processing in the vehicle ECU is expected. Examples of such scenarios include cases where the brake response is clearly delayed or when the vehicle rotates due to a single-side tire slipping. These tasks are typically handled by ABS or ESC.
