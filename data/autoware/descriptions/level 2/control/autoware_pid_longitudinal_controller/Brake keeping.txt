From the viewpoint of ride comfort, stopping with 0 acceleration is important because it reduces the impact of braking. However, if the target acceleration when stopping is 0, the vehicle may cross over the stop line or accelerate a little in front of the stop line due to vehicle model error or gradient estimation error.

For reliable stopping, the target acceleration calculated by the FeedForward system is limited to a negative acceleration when stopping.
