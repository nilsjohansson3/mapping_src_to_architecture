| :---------------------------------- | :----- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------ |
| drive_state_stop_dist               | double | The state will transit to DRIVE when the distance to the stop point is longer than `drive_state_stop_dist` + `drive_state_offset_stop_dist` [m]                      | 0.5           |
| drive_state_offset_stop_dist        | double | The state will transit to DRIVE when the distance to the stop point is longer than `drive_state_stop_dist` + `drive_state_offset_stop_dist` [m]                      | 1.0           |
| stopping_state_stop_dist            | double | The state will transit to STOPPING when the distance to the stop point is shorter than `stopping_state_stop_dist` [m]                                                | 0.5           |
| stopped_state_entry_vel             | double | threshold of the ego velocity in transition to the STOPPED state [m/s]                                                                                               | 0.01          |
| stopped_state_entry_acc             | double | threshold of the ego acceleration in transition to the STOPPED state [m/s^2]                                                                                         | 0.1           |
| emergency_state_overshoot_stop_dist | double | If `enable_overshoot_emergency` is true and the ego is `emergency_state_overshoot_stop_dist`-meter ahead of the stop point, the state will transit to EMERGENCY. [m] | 1.5           |
| emergency_state_traj_trans_dev      | double | If the ego's position is `emergency_state_traj_tran_dev` meter away from the nearest trajectory point, the state will transit to EMERGENCY. [m]                      | 3.0           |
| emergency_state_traj_rot_dev        | double | If the ego's orientation is `emergency_state_traj_rot_dev` rad away from the nearest trajectory point orientation, the state will transit to EMERGENCY. [rad]        | 0.784         |
