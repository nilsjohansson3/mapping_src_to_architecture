1. Smoothed target velocity and its acceleration shall be set in the trajectory
   1. The velocity command is not smoothed inside the controller (only noise may be removed).
   2. For step-like target signal, tracking is performed as fast as possible.
2. The vehicle velocity must be an appropriate value
   1. The ego-velocity must be a signed-value corresponding to the forward/backward direction
   2. The ego-velocity should be given with appropriate noise processing.
   3. If there is a large amount of noise in the ego-velocity, the tracking performance will be significantly reduced.
3. The output of this controller must be achieved by later modules (e.g. vehicle interface).
   1. If the vehicle interface does not have the target velocity or acceleration interface (e.g., the vehicle only has a gas pedal and brake interface), an appropriate conversion must be done after this controller.
