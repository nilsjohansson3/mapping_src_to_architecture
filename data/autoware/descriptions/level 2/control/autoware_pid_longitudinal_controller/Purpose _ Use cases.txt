The longitudinal_controller computes the target acceleration to achieve the target velocity set at each point of the target trajectory using a feed-forward/back control.

It also contains a slope force correction that takes into account road slope information, and a delay compensation function.
It is assumed that the target acceleration calculated here will be properly realized by the vehicle interface.

Note that the use of this module is not mandatory for Autoware if the vehicle supports the "target speed" interface.
