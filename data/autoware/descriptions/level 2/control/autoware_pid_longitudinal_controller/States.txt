This module has four state transitions as shown below in order to handle special processing in a specific situation.

- **DRIVE**
  - Executes target velocity tracking by PID control.
  - It also applies the delay compensation and slope compensation.
- **STOPPING**
  - Controls the motion just before stopping.
  - Special sequence is performed to achieve accurate and smooth stopping.
- **STOPPED**
  - Performs operations in the stopped state (e.g. brake hold)
- **EMERGENCY**.
  - Enters an emergency state when certain conditions are met (e.g., when the vehicle has crossed a certain distance of a stop line).
  - The recovery condition (whether or not to keep emergency state until the vehicle completely stops) or the deceleration in the emergency state are defined by parameters.

The state transition diagram is shown below.
