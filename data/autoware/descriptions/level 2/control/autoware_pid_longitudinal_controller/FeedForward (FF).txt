The reference acceleration set in the trajectory and slope compensation terms are output as a feedforward. Under ideal conditions with no modeling error, this FF term alone should be sufficient for velocity tracking.

Tracking errors causing modeling or discretization errors are removed by the feedback control (now using PID).
