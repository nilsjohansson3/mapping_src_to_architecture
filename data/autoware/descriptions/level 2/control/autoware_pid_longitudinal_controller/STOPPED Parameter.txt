The `STOPPED` state assumes that the vehicle is completely stopped with the brakes fully applied.
Therefore, `stopped_acc` should be set to a value that allows the vehicle to apply the strongest possible brake.
If `stopped_acc` is not sufficiently low, there is a possibility of sliding down on steep slopes.
