In the fourth step, it checks the collision with the closest obstacle point using RSS distance. RSS distance is formulated as:

$$
d = v_{ego}*t_{response} + v_{ego}^2/(2*a_{min}) -(sign(v_{obj})) * v_{obj}^2/(2*a_{obj_{min}}) + offset
$$

where $v_{ego}$ and $v_{obj}$ is current ego and obstacle velocity, $a_{min}$ and $a_{obj_{min}}$ is ego and object minimum acceleration (maximum deceleration), $t_{response}$ is response time of the ego vehicle to start deceleration. Therefore the distance from the ego vehicle to the obstacle is smaller than this RSS distance $d$, the ego vehicle send emergency stop signals. This is illustrated in the following picture.
