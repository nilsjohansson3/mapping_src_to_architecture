The AEB module can filter the input pointcloud to find target obstacles with which the ego vehicle might collide. This method can be enable if the `use_pointcloud_data` parameter is set to true. The pointcloud obstacle filtering has three major steps, which are rough filtering, noise filtering with clustering and rigorous filtering.
