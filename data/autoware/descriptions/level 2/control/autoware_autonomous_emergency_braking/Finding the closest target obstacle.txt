Once all target obstacles have been identified, the AEB module chooses the point that is closest to the ego vehicle as the candidate for collision checking. Only the closest point is considered because RSS distance is used to judge if a collision will happen or not, and if the closest vertex to the ego is deemed to be safe from collision, the rest of the target obstacles will also be safe.
