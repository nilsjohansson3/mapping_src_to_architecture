If the `use_predicted_object_data` parameter is set to true, the AEB can use predicted object data coming from the perception modules, to get target obstacle points. This is done by obtaining the 2D intersection points between the ego's predicted footprint path and each of the predicted objects enveloping polygon or bounding box.
