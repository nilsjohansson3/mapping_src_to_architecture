To prevent the AEB from considering noisy points, euclidean clustering is performed on the filtered point cloud. The points in the point cloud that are not close enough to other points to form a cluster are discarded. Furthermore, each point in a cluster is compared against the `cluster_minimum_height` parameter, if no point inside a cluster has a height/z value greater than `cluster_minimum_height`, the whole cluster of points is discarded. The parameters `cluster_tolerance`, `minimum_cluster_size` and `maximum_cluster_size` can be used to tune the clustering and the size of objects to be ignored, for more information about the clustering method used by the AEB module, please check the official documentation on euclidean clustering of the PCL library: <https://pcl.readthedocs.io/projects/tutorials/en/master/cluster_extraction.html>.

Furthermore, a 2D convex hull is created around each detected cluster, the vertices of each hull represent the most extreme/outside points of the cluster. These vertices are then checked in the next step.
