The AEB can activate when a vehicle in front suddenly brakes, and a collision is detected by the AEB module. Provided the distance between the ego vehicle and the front vehicle is large enough and the egoâ€™s emergency acceleration value is high enough, it is possible to avoid or soften collisions with vehicles in front that suddenly brake. NOTE: the acceleration used by the AEB to calculate rss_distance is NOT necessarily the acceleration used by the ego while doing an emergency brake. The acceleration used by the real vehicle can be tuned by changing the [mrm_emergency stop jerk and acceleration values](https://github.com/tier4/autoware_launch/blob/d1b2688f2788acab95bb9995d72efd7182e9006a/autoware_launch/config/system/mrm_emergency_stop_operator/mrm_emergency_stop_operator.param.yamlL4).
