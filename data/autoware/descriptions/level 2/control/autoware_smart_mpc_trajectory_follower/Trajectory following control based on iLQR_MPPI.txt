The control mode can be selected from "ilqr", "mppi", or "mppi_ilqr", and can be set as `mpc_parameter:system:mode` in [mpc_param.yaml](./autoware_smart_mpc_trajectory_follower/param/mpc_param.yaml).
In "mppi_ilqr" mode, the initial value of iLQR is given by the MPPI solution.

> [!NOTE]
> With the default settings, the performance of "mppi" mode is limited due to an insufficient number of samples. This issue is being addressed with ongoing work to introduce GPU support.

To perform a simulation, run the following command:

```bash
ros2 launch autoware_launch planning_simulator.launch.xml map_path:=$HOME/autoware_map/sample-map-planning vehicle_model:=sample_vehicle sensor_model:=sample_sensor_kit trajectory_follower_mode:=smart_mpc_trajectory_follower
```

> [!NOTE]
> When running with the nominal model set in [nominal_param.yaml](./autoware_smart_mpc_trajectory_follower/param/nominal_param.yaml), set `trained_model_parameter:control_application:use_trained_model` to `false` in [trained_model_param.yaml](./autoware_smart_mpc_trajectory_follower/param/trained_model_param.yaml). To run using the trained model, set `trained_model_parameter:control_application:use_trained_model` to `true`, but the trained model must have been generated according to the following procedure.
