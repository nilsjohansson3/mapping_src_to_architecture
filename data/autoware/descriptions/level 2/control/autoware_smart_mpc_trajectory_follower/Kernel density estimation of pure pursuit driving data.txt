The distribution of data obtained from pure pursuit runs can be displayed using Kernel density estimation. To do this, run [density_estimation.ipynb](./autoware_smart_mpc_trajectory_follower/python_simulator/density_estimation.ipynb).

The correlation between the minimum value of the density estimate and the lateral deviation of the run results is low. A scalar indicator that better predicts the value of lateral deviation is under development.
