If the predicted trajectory deviates too far from the target trajectory, the system enters a slow stop mode and the vehicle stops moving.
To cancel the slow stop mode and make the vehicle ready to run again, run the following command:

```bash
ros2 topic pub /pympc_stop_mode_reset_request std_msgs/msg/String "data: ''" --once
```
