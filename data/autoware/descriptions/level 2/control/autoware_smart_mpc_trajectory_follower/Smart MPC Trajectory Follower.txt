Smart MPC (Model Predictive Control) is a control algorithm that combines model predictive control and machine learning. While inheriting the advantages of model predictive control, it solves its disadvantage of modeling difficulty with a data-driven method using machine learning.

This technology makes it relatively easy to operate model predictive control, which is expensive to implement, as long as an environment for collecting data can be prepared.
