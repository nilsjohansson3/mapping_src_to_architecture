To perform a control test on autoware with the nominal model before training, make sure that `trained_model_parameter:control_application:use_trained_model` in [trained_model_param.yaml](./autoware_smart_mpc_trajectory_follower/param/trained_model_param.yaml) is `false` and launch autoware in the manner described in "Trajectory following control based on iLQR/MPPI". This time, the following route will be used for the test:

Record rosbag and train the model in the manner described in "Training of model and reflection in control", and move the generated files `model_for_test_drive.pth` and `polynomial_reg_info.npz` to the home directory.
Sample models, which work under the condition that`trained_model_parameter:memory_for_training:use_memory_for_training` in [trained_model_param.yaml](./autoware_smart_mpc_trajectory_follower/param/trained_model_param.yaml) is set to `true`, can be obtained at [sample_models/wheel_base_changed](./sample_models/wheel_base_changed/).

> [!NOTE]
> Although the data used for training is small, for the sake of simplicity, we will see how much performance can be improved with this amount of data.

To control using the trained model obtained here, set `trained_model_parameter:control_application:use_trained_model` to `true`, start autoware in the same way, and drive the same route recording rosbag.
After the driving is complete, convert the rosbag file to CSV format using the method described in "Training of model and reflection in control".
A plot of the lateral deviation is obtained by running the `lateral_error_visualize` function in `control/autoware_smart_mpc_trajectory_follower/autoware_smart_mpc_trajectory_follower/training_and_data_check/data_checker.ipynb` for the nominal and training model rosbag files `rosbag_nominal` and `rosbag_trained`, respectively, as follows:

```python
lateral_error_visualize(dir_name=rosbag_nominal,ylim=[-1.2,1.2])
lateral_error_visualize(dir_name=rosbag_trained,ylim=[-1.2,1.2])
```

The following results were obtained.
