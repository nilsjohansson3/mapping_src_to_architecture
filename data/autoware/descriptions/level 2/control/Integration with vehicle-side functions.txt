ABS (Anti-lock Brake System) and ESC (Electric Stability Control) are two functions that may be pre-installed on a vehicle, directly impacting its controllability.
The control modules of Autoware assume that both ABS and ESC are installed on the vehicle and their absence may cause unreliable controls depending on the target ODD. For example, with low-velocity driving in a controlled environment, these functions are not necessary.

Also, note that this statement does not negate the development of ABS functionality in autonomous driving systems.
