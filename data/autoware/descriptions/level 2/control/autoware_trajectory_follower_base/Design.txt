There are lateral and longitudinal base interface classes and each algorithm inherits from this class to implement.
The interface class has the following base functions.

- `isReady()`: Check if the control is ready to compute.
- `run()`: Compute control commands and return to [Trajectory Follower Nodes](../autoware_trajectory_follower_node/README.md). This must be implemented by inherited algorithms.
- `sync()`: Input the result of running the other controller.
  - steer angle convergence
    - allow keeping stopped until steer is converged.
  - velocity convergence(currently not used)

See [the Design of Trajectory Follower Nodes](../autoware_trajectory_follower_node/README.mdDesign) for how these functions work in the node.
