The longitudinal vehicle behavior that humans expect is difficult to express in a single logic. For example, the expected behavior just before stopping differs depending on whether the ego-position is ahead/behind of the stop line, or whether the current speed is higher/lower than the target speed to achieve a human-like movement.

In addition, some vehicles have difficulty measuring the ego-speed at extremely low speeds. In such cases, a configuration that can improve the functionality of the longitudinal control without affecting the lateral control is important.

There are many characteristics and needs that are unique to longitudinal control. Designing them separately from the lateral control keeps the modules less coupled and improves maintainability.
