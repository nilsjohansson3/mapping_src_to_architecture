This longitudinal controller assumes that the roles of lateral and longitudinal control are separated as follows.

- Lateral control computes a target steering to keep the vehicle on the trajectory, assuming perfect velocity tracking.
- Longitudinal control computes a target velocity/acceleration to keep the vehicle velocity on the trajectory speed, assuming perfect trajectory tracking.

Ideally, dealing with the lateral and longitudinal control as a single mixed problem can achieve high performance. In contrast, there are two reasons to provide velocity controller as a stand-alone function, described below.
