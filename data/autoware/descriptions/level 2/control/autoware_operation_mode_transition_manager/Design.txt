Here we see that `autoware_operation_mode_transition_manager` has multiple state transitions as follows

- **AUTOWARE ENABLED <---> DISABLED**
  - **ENABLED**: the vehicle is controlled by Autoware.
  - **DISABLED**: the vehicle is out of Autoware control, expecting the e.g. manual driving.
- **AUTOWARE ENABLED <---> AUTO/LOCAL/REMOTE/NONE**
  - **AUTO**: the vehicle is controlled by Autoware, with the autonomous control command calculated by the planning/control component.
  - **LOCAL**: the vehicle is controlled by Autoware, with the locally connected operator, e.g. joystick controller.
  - **REMOTE**: the vehicle is controlled by Autoware, with the remotely connected operator.
  - **NONE**: the vehicle is not controlled by any operator.
- **IN TRANSITION <---> COMPLETED**
  - **IN TRANSITION**: the mode listed above is in the transition process, expecting the former operator to have a responsibility to confirm the transition is completed.
  - **COMPLETED**: the mode transition is completed.
