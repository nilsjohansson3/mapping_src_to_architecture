The Predicted Path Checker package is designed for autonomous vehicles to check the predicted path generated by control
modules. It handles potential collisions that the planning module might not be able to handle and that in the brake
distance. In case of collision in brake distance, the package will send a diagnostic message labeled "ERROR" to alert
the system to send emergency and in the case of collisions in outside reference trajectory, it sends pause request to
pause interface to make the vehicle stop.
