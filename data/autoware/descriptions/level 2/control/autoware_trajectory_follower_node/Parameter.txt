- `ctrl_period`: control commands publishing period
- `timeout_thr_sec`: duration in second after which input messages are discarded.
  - Each time the node receives lateral and longitudinal commands from each controller, it publishes an `Control` if the following two conditions are met.
    1. Both commands have been received.
    2. The last received commands are not older than defined by `timeout_thr_sec`.
- `lateral_controller_mode`: `mpc` or `pure_pursuit`
  - (currently there is only `PID` for longitudinal controller)
