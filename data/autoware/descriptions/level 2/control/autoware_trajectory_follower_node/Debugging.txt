Debug information are published by the lateral and longitudinal controller using `tier4_debug_msgs/Float32MultiArrayStamped` messages.

A configuration file for [PlotJuggler](https://github.com/facontidavide/PlotJuggler) is provided in the `config` folder which, when loaded, allow to automatically subscribe and visualize information useful for debugging.

In addition, the predicted MPC trajectory is published on topic `output/lateral/predicted_trajectory` and can be visualized in Rviz.
