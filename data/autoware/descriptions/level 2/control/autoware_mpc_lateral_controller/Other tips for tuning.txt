Here are some tips for adjusting other parameters:

- In theory, increasing terminal weights, `weight_terminal_lat_error` and `weight_terminal_heading_error`, can enhance the tracking stability. This method sometimes proves effective.
- A larger `prediction_horizon` and a smaller `prediction_sampling_time` are efficient for tracking performance. However, these come at the cost of higher computational costs.
- If you want to modify the weight according to the trajectory curvature (for instance, when you're driving on a sharp curve and want a larger weight), use `mpc_low_curvature_thresh_curvature` and adjust `mpc_low_curvature_weight_**` weights.
- If you want to adjust the steering rate limit based on the vehicle speed and trajectory curvature, you can modify the values of `steer_rate_lim_dps_list_by_curvature`, `curvature_list_for_steer_rate_lim`, `steer_rate_lim_dps_list_by_velocity`, `velocity_list_for_steer_rate_lim`. By doing this, you can enforce the steering rate limit during high-speed driving or relax it while curving.
- In case your target curvature appears jagged, adjusting `curvature_smoothing` becomes critically important for accurate curvature calculations. A larger value yields a smooth curvature calculation which reduces noise but can cause delay in feedforward computation and potentially degrade performance.
- Adjusting the `steering_lpf_cutoff_hz` value can also be effective to forcefully reduce computational noise. This refers to the cutoff frequency in the second order Butterworth filter installed in the final layer. The smaller the cutoff frequency, the stronger the noise reduction, but it also induce operation delay.
- If the vehicle consistently deviates laterally from the trajectory, it's most often due to the offset of the steering sensor or self-position estimation. It's preferable to eliminate these biases before inputting into MPC, but it's also possible to remove this bias within MPC. To utilize this, set `enable_auto_steering_offset_removal` to true and activate the steering offset remover. The steering offset estimation logic works when driving at high speeds with the steering close to the center, applying offset removal.
- If the onset of steering in curves is late, it's often due to incorrect delay time and time constant in the steering model. Please recheck the values of `input_delay` and `vehicle_model_steer_tau`. Additionally, as a part of its debug information, MPC outputs the current steering angle assumed by the MPC model, so please check if that steering angle matches the actual one.
