First, it's important to set the appropriate parameters for vehicle kinematics. This includes parameters like `wheelbase`, which represents the distance between the front and rear wheels, and `max_steering_angle`, which indicates the maximum tire steering angle. These parameters should be set in the `vehicle_info.param.yaml`.
