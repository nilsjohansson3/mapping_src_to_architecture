The node uses an implementation of linear model predictive control (MPC) for accurate path tracking.
The MPC uses a model of the vehicle to simulate the trajectory resulting from the control command.
The optimization of the control command is formulated as a Quadratic Program (QP).

Different vehicle models are implemented:

- kinematics : bicycle kinematics model with steering 1st-order delay.
- kinematics_no_delay : bicycle kinematics model without steering delay.
- dynamics : bicycle dynamics model considering slip angle.
  The kinematics model is being used by default. Please see the reference [1] for more details.

For the optimization, a Quadratic Programming (QP) solver is used and two options are currently implemented:

<!-- cspell: ignore ADMM -->

- unconstraint_fast : use least square method to solve unconstraint QP with eigen.
- [osqp](https://osqp.org/): run the [following ADMM](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/admm_distr_stats.html)
  algorithm (for more details see the related papers at
