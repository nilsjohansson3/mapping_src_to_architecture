**Step 1.** Install MMEngine, MMCV, and MMDetection using MIM

```bash
pip install -U openmim
mim install mmengine
mim install 'mmcv>=2.0.0rc4'
mim install 'mmdet>=3.0.0rc5, <3.3.0'
```

**Step 2.** Install mmdetection3d forked repository

Introduced several valuable enhancements in our fork of the mmdetection3d repository.
Notably, we've made the PointPillar z voxel feature input optional to maintain compatibility with the original paper.
In addition, we've integrated a PyTorch to ONNX converter and a T4 format reader for added functionality.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/autowarefoundation/mmdetection3d.git
cd mmdetection3d
pip install -v -e .
```
