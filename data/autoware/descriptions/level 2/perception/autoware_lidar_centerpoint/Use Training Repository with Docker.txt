Alternatively, you can use Docker to run the mmdetection3d repository. We provide a Dockerfile to build a Docker image with the mmdetection3d repository and its dependencies.

Clone fork of the mmdetection3d repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/autowarefoundation/mmdetection3d.git
```

Build the Docker image by running the following command:

```bash
cd mmdetection3d
docker build -t mmdetection3d -f docker/Dockerfile .
```

Run the Docker container:

```bash
docker run --gpus all --shm-size=8g -it -v {DATA_DIR}:/mmdetection3d/data mmdetection3d
```
