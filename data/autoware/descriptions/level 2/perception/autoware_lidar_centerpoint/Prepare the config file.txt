The configuration file that illustrates how to train the CenterPoint model with the NuScenes dataset is
located at `mmdetection3d/projects/AutowareCenterPoint/configs`. This configuration file is a derived version of
[this centerpoint configuration file](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/mmdetection3d/blob/5c0613be29bd2e51771ec5e046d89ba3089887c7/configs/centerpoint/centerpoint_pillar02_second_secfpn_head-circlenms_8xb4-cyclic-20e_nus-3d.py)
from mmdetection3D.
In this custom configuration, the **use_voxel_center_z parameter** is set as **False** to deactivate the z coordinate of the voxel center,
aligning with the original paper's specifications and making the model compatible with Autoware. Additionally, the filter size is set as **[32, 32]**.

The CenterPoint model can be tailored to your specific requirements by modifying various parameters within the configuration file.
This includes adjustments related to preprocessing operations, training, testing, model architecture, dataset, optimizer, learning rate scheduler, and more.
