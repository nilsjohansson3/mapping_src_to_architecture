The autoware_lidar_centerpoint implementation requires two ONNX models as input the voxel encoder and the backbone-neck-head of the CenterPoint model, other aspects of the network,
such as preprocessing operations, are implemented externally. Under the fork of the mmdetection3d repository,
we have included a script that converts the CenterPoint model to Autoware compatible ONNX format.
You can find it in `mmdetection3d/projects/AutowareCenterPoint` file.

```bash
python projects/AutowareCenterPoint/centerpoint_onnx_converter.py --cfg projects/AutowareCenterPoint/configs/centerpoint_custom.py --ckpt work_dirs/centerpoint_custom/YOUR_BEST_MODEL.pth --work-dir ./work_dirs/onnx_models
```
