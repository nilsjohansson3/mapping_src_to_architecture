The autoware detection by tracker receives an unknown object containing a point cloud and a tracker, where the unknown object is mainly shape-fitted using euclidean clustering.
Shape fitting using euclidean clustering and other methods has a problem called under segmentation and over segmentation.

Simply looking at the overlap between the unknown object and the tracker does not work. We need to take measures for under segmentation and over segmentation.
