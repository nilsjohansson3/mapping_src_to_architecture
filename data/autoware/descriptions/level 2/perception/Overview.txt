The Perception Component receives inputs from Sensing, Localization, and Map components, and adds semantic information (e.g., Object Recognition, Obstacle Segmentation, Traffic Light Recognition, Occupancy Grid Map), which is then passed on to Planning Component. This component design follows the overarching philosophy of Autoware, defined as the [microautonomy concept](https://autowarefoundation.github.io/autoware-documentation/main/design/autoware-concepts/).
