This filter is a combination of the distance_based_compare_map_filter and voxel_based_approximate_compare_map_filter. The filter loads the map point cloud, which can be loaded statically at the beginning or dynamically during vehicle movement, and creates a voxel grid and a k-d tree of the map point cloud. The filter uses the getCentroidIndexAt function in combination with the getGridCoordinates function from the VoxelGrid class to find input points that are inside the voxel grid and removes them. For points that do not belong to any voxel grid, they are compared again with the map point cloud using the radiusSearch function of the k-d tree and are removed if they are close enough to the map.
