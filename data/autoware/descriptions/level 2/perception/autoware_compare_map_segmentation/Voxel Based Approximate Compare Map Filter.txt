The filter loads the map point cloud, which can be loaded statically at the beginning or dynamically during vehicle movement, and creates a voxel grid of the map point cloud. The filter uses the getCentroidIndexAt function in combination with the getGridCoordinates function from the VoxelGrid class to find input points that are inside the voxel grid and removes them.
