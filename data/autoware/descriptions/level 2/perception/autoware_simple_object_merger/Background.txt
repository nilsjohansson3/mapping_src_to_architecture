[Object_merger](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.universe/tree/main/perception/object_merger) is mainly used for merge process with DetectedObjects. There are 2 characteristics in `Object_merger`. First, `object_merger` solve data association algorithm like Hungarian algorithm for matching problem, but it needs computational cost. Second, `object_merger` can handle only 2 DetectedObjects topics and cannot handle more than 2 topics in one node. To merge 6 DetectedObjects topics, 6 `object_merger` nodes need to stand for now.

Therefore, `autoware_simple_object_merger` aim to merge multiple DetectedObjects with low calculation cost.
The package do not use data association algorithm to reduce the computational cost, and it can handle more than 2 topics in one node to prevent launching a large number of nodes.
