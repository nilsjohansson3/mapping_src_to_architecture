Path generation is generated on the frenet frame. The path is generated by the following steps:

1. Get the frenet frame of the reference path.
2. Generate the frenet frame of the current position of the object and the finite position of the object.
3. Optimize the path in each longitudinal and lateral coordinate of the frenet frame. (Use the quintic polynomial to fit start and end conditions.)
4. Convert the path to the global coordinate.
