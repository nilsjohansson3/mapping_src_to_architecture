Since this module tries to predict the vehicle's path several seconds into the future, it is not practical to consider the current vehicle's acceleration as constant (it is not assumed the vehicle will be accelerating for `prediction_time_horizon` seconds after detection). Instead, a decaying acceleration model is used. With the decaying acceleration model, a vehicle's acceleration is modeled as:

$\ a(t) = a\_{t0} \cdot e^{-\lambda \cdot t} $

where $\ a\_{t0} $ is the vehicle acceleration at the time of detection $\ t0 $, and $\ \lambda $ is the decay constant $\ \lambda = \ln(2) / hl $ and $\ hl $ is the exponential's half life.

Furthermore, the integration of $\ a(t) $ over time gives us equations for velocity, $\ v(t) $ and distance $\ x(t) $ as:

$\ v(t) = v*{t0} + a*{t0} \* (1/\lambda) \cdot (1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot t}) $

and

$\ x(t) = x*{t0} + (v*{t0} + a*{t0} \* (1/\lambda)) \cdot t + a*{t0}(1/Î»^2)(e^{-\lambda \cdot t} - 1) $

With this model, the influence of the vehicle's detected instantaneous acceleration on the predicted path's length is diminished but still considered. This feature also considers that the obstacle might not accelerate past its road's speed limit (multiplied by a tunable factor).

Currently, we provide three parameters to tune the use of obstacle acceleration for path prediction:

- `use_vehicle_acceleration`: to enable the feature.
- `acceleration_exponential_half_life`: The decaying acceleration model considers that the current vehicle acceleration will be halved after this many seconds.
- `speed_limit_multiplier`: Set the vehicle type obstacle's maximum predicted speed as the legal speed limit in that lanelet times this value. This value should be at least equal or greater than 1.0.

You can change these parameters in `rosparam` in the table below.

| Param Name                           | Default Value  |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------- |
| `use_vehicle_acceleration`           | `false` [bool] |
| `acceleration_exponential_half_life` | `2.5` [s]      |
| `speed_limit_multiplier`             | `1.5` []       |
