Search one or more lanelets satisfying the following conditions for each target object and store them in the ObjectData.

- The CoG of the object must be inside the lanelet.
- The centerline of the lanelet must have two or more points.
- The angle difference between the lanelet and the direction of the object must be within the threshold given by the parameters.
  - The angle flip is allowed, the condition is `diff_yaw < threshold or diff_yaw > pi - threshold`.
- The lanelet must be reachable from the lanelet recorded in the past history.
