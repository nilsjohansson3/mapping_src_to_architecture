Lateral velocity calculation is also a very important factor for lane change decision because it is used in the time domain decision.

The predicted time to reach the lane boundary is calculated by

$$
t_{predicted} = \dfrac{d_{lat}}{v_{lat}}
$$

where $d_{lat}$ and $v_{lat}$ represent the lateral distance to the lane boundary and the lateral velocity, respectively.

Lowering the cutoff frequency of the low-pass filter for lateral velocity will make the lane change decision more stable but slower. Our setting is very conservative, so you may increase this parameter if you want to make the lane change decision faster.

For the additional information, here we show how we calculate lateral velocity.

| [**applied**] time derivative of lateral distance             | $\dfrac{\Delta d_{lat}}{\Delta t}$ | Currently, we use this method to deal with winding roads. Since this time differentiation easily becomes noisy, we also use a low-pass filter to get smoothed velocity.                                                           |
| [not applied] Object Velocity Projection to Lateral Direction | $v_{obj} \sin(\theta)$             | Normally, object velocities are less noisy than the time derivative of lateral distance. But the yaw difference $\theta$ between the lane and object directions sometimes becomes discontinuous, so we did not adopt this method. |

Currently, we use the upper method with a low-pass filter to calculate lateral velocity.
