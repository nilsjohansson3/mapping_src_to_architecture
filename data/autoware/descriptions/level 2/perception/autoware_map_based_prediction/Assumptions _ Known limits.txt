- For object types of passenger car, bus, and truck
  - The predicted path of the object follows the road structure.
  - For the object not being on any roads, the predicted path is generated by just a straight line prediction.
  - For the object on a lanelet but moving in a different direction of the road, the predicted path is just straight.
  - Vehicle dynamics may not be properly considered in the predicted path.
- For object types of person and motorcycle
  - The predicted path is generated by just a straight line in all situations except for "around crosswalk".
- For all obstacles
  - In the prediction, the vehicle motion is assumed to be a constant velocity due to a lack of acceleration information.
