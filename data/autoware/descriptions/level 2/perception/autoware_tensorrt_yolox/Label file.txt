A sample label file (named `label.txt`) and semantic segmentation color map file (name `semseg_color_map.csv`) are also downloaded automatically during env preparation process
(**NOTE:** This file is incompatible with models that output labels for the COCO dataset (e.g., models from the official YOLOX repository)).

This file represents the correspondence between class index (integer outputted from YOLOX network) and
class label (strings making understanding easier). This package maps class IDs (incremented from 0)
with labels according to the order in this file.
