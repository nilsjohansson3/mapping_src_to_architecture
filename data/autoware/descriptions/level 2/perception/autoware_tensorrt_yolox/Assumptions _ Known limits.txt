The label contained in detected 2D bounding boxes (i.e., `out/objects`) will be either one of the followings:

- CAR
- PEDESTRIAN ("PERSON" will also be categorized as "PEDESTRIAN")
- BUS
- TRUCK
- BICYCLE
- MOTORCYCLE

If other labels (case insensitive) are contained in the file specified via the `label_file` parameter,
those are labeled as `UNKNOWN`, while detected rectangles are drawn in the visualization result (`out/image`).

The semantic segmentation mask is a gray image whose each pixel is index of one following class:

| index | semantic name    |
| ----- | ---------------- |
| 0     | road             |
| 1     | building         |
| 2     | wall             |
| 3     | obstacle         |
| 4     | traffic_light    |
| 5     | traffic_sign     |
| 6     | person           |
| 7     | vehicle          |
| 8     | bike             |
| 9     | road             |
| 10    | sidewalk         |
| 11    | roadPaint        |
| 12    | curbstone        |
| 13    | crosswalk_others |
| 14    | vegetation       |
| 15    | sky              |
