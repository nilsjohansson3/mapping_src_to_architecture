This diagram describes the high-level architecture of the Perception Component.

![overall-perception-architecture](image/high-level-perception-diagram.drawio.svg)

The Perception Component consists of the following sub-components:

- **Object Recognition**: Recognizes dynamic objects surrounding the ego vehicle in the current frame, objects that were not present during map creation, and predicts their future trajectories. This includes:
  - Pedestrians
  - Cars
  - Trucks/Buses
  - Bicycles
  - Motorcycles
  - Animals
  - Traffic cones
  - Road debris: Items such as cardboard, oil drums, trash cans, wood, etc., either dropped on the road or floating in the air
- **Obstacle Segmentation**: Identifies point clouds originating from obstacles, including both dynamic objects and static obstacles that requires the ego vehicle either steer clear of them or come to a stop in front of the obstacles.
  - This includes:
    - All dynamic objects (as listed above)
    - Curbs/Bollards
    - Barriers
    - Trees
    - Walls/Buildings
  - This does not include:
    - Grass
    - Water splashes
    - Smoke/Vapor
    - Newspapers
    - Plastic bags
- **Occupancy Grid Map**: Detects blind spots (areas where no information is available and where dynamic objects may jump out).
- **Traffic Light Recognition**: Recognizes the colors of traffic lights and the directions of arrow signals.
