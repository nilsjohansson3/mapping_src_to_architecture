`autoware_traffic_light_occlusion_predictor` receives the detected traffic lights rois and calculates the occlusion ratios of each roi with point cloud.

For each traffic light roi, hundreds of pixels would be selected and projected into the 3D space. Then from the camera point of view, the number of projected pixels that are occluded by the point cloud is counted and used for calculating the occlusion ratio for the roi. As shown in follow image, the red pixels are occluded and the occlusion ratio is the number of red pixels divided by the total pixel numbers.

If no point cloud is received or all point clouds have very large stamp difference with the camera image, the occlusion ratio of each roi would be set as 0.
