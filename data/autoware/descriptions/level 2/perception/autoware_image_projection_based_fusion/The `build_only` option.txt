The `pointpainting_fusion` node has `build_only` option to build the TensorRT engine file from the ONNX file.
Although it is preferred to move all the ROS parameters in `.param.yaml` file in Autoware Universe, the `build_only` option is not moved to the `.param.yaml` file for now, because it may be used as a flag to execute the build as a pre-task. You can execute with the following command:

```bash
ros2 launch autoware_image_projection_based_fusion pointpainting_fusion.launch.xml model_name:=pointpainting model_path:=/home/autoware/autoware_data/image_projection_based_fusion model_param_path:=$(ros2 pkg prefix autoware_image_projection_based_fusion --share)/config/pointpainting.param.yaml build_only:=true
```
