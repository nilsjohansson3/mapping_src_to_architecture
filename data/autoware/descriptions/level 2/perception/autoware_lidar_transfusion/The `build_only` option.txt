The `autoware_lidar_transfusion` node has `build_only` option to build the TensorRT engine file from the ONNX file.
Although it is preferred to move all the ROS parameters in `.param.yaml` file in Autoware Universe, the `build_only` option is not moved to the `.param.yaml` file for now, because it may be used as a flag to execute the build as a pre-task. You can execute with the following command:

```bash
ros2 launch autoware_lidar_transfusion lidar_transfusion.launch.xml build_only:=true
```
