In the data association, we use the following rules to determine whether two tracking objects are the same object.

- gating
  - `distance gate`: distance between two tracking objects
  - `angle gate`: angle between two tracking objects
  - `mahalanobis_distance_gate`: Mahalanobis distance between two tracking objects
  - `min_iou_gate`: minimum IoU between two tracking objects
  - `max_velocity_gate`: maximum velocity difference between two tracking objects
- score
  - score used in matching is equivalent to the distance between two tracking objects
