Sub tracking objects are merged into dominant tracking objects.

Depends on the tracklet input sensor state, we update the tracklet state with different rules.

| state\priority             | 1st    | 2nd   | 3rd    |
| -------------------------- | ------ | ----- | ------ |
| Kinematics except velocity | LiDAR  | Radar | Camera |
| Forward velocity           | Radar  | LiDAR | Camera |
| Object classification      | Camera | LiDAR | Radar  |
