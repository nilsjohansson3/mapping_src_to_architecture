We use the `existence_probability` to manage tracklet.

- When we create a new tracklet, we set the `existence_probability` to $p_{sensor}$ value.
- In each update with specific sensor, we set the `existence_probability` to $p_{sensor}$ value.
- When tracklet does not have update with specific sensor, we reduce the `existence_probability` by `decay_rate`
- Object can be published if `existence_probability` is larger than `publish_probability_threshold` and time from last update is smaller than `max_dt`
- Object will be removed if `existence_probability` is smaller than `remove_probability_threshold` and time from last update is larger than `max_dt`

These parameter can be set in `config/decorative_tracker_merger.param.yaml`.

```yaml

  default_radar_existence_probability: 0.6
  default_camera_existence_probability: 0.6
  decay_rate: 0.1
  max_dt: 1.0
