As explained in [tracklet management](tracklet-management), this tracker merger tend to maintain the both input tracking objects.

- decrease `default_<sensor>_existence_probability` of that sensor
- increase `decay_rate`
- increase `publish_probability_threshold` to publish only reliable tracking objects
