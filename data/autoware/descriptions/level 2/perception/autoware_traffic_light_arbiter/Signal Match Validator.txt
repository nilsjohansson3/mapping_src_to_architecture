When `enable_signal_matching` is set to true, this node validates the match between perception signals and external signals.
The table below outlines how the matching process determines the output based on the combination of perception and external signal colors. Each cell represents the outcome when a specific color from a perception signal (columns) intersects with a color from an external signal (rows).

| External \ Perception | RED     | AMBER   | GREEN   | UNKNOWN | Not Received |
| --------------------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------------ |
| RED                   | RED     | UNKNOWN | UNKNOWN | UNKNOWN | UNKNOWN      |
| AMBER                 | UNKNOWN | AMBER   | UNKNOWN | UNKNOWN | UNKNOWN      |
| GREEN                 | UNKNOWN | UNKNOWN | GREEN   | UNKNOWN | UNKNOWN      |
| UNKNOWN               | UNKNOWN | UNKNOWN | UNKNOWN | UNKNOWN | UNKNOWN      |
| Not Received          | UNKNOWN | UNKNOWN | UNKNOWN | UNKNOWN | UNKNOWN      |
