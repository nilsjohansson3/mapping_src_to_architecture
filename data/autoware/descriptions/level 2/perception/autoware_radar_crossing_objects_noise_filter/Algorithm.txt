To filter the objects crossing to ego vehicle, this package filter the objects as below algorithm.

![algorithm](docs/radar_crossing_objects_noise_filter.drawio.svg)

```cpp
  // If velocity of an object is rather than the velocity_threshold,
  // and crossing_yaw is near to vertical
  // angle_threshold < crossing_yaw < pi - angle_threshold
  if (
    velocity > node_param_.velocity_threshold &&
    abs(std::cos(crossing_yaw)) < abs(std::cos(node_param_.angle_threshold))) {
    // Object is noise object;
  } else {
    // Object is not noise object;
  }
```
