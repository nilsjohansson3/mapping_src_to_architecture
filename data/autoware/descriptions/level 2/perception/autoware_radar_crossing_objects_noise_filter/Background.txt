This package aim to filter the noise objects which cross from the ego vehicle.
The reason why these objects are noise is as below.

- 1. The objects with doppler velocity can be trusted more than those with vertical velocity to it.

Radars can get velocity information of objects as doppler velocity, but cannot get vertical velocity to doppler velocity directory.
Some radars can output the objects with not only doppler velocity but also vertical velocity by estimation.
If the vertical velocity estimation is poor, it leads to output noise objects.
In other words, the above situation is that the objects which has vertical twist viewed from ego vehicle can tend to be noise objects.

The example is below figure.
Velocity estimation fails on static objects, resulting in ghost objects crossing in front of ego vehicles.

- 2. Turning around by ego vehicle affect the output from radar.

When the ego vehicle turns around, the radars outputting at the object level sometimes fail to estimate the twist of objects correctly even if [radar_tracks_msgs_converter](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.universe/tree/main/perception/autoware_radar_tracks_msgs_converter) compensates by the ego vehicle twist.
So if an object detected by radars has circular motion viewing from base_link, it is likely that the speed is estimated incorrectly and that the object is a static object.

The example is below figure.
When the ego vehicle turn right, the surrounding objects have left circular motion.
