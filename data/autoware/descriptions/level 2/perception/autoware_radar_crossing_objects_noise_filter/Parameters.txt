- `angle_threshold` (double) [rad]
  - Default parameter is 1.0472.

This parameter is the angle threshold to filter. It has condition that 0 < `angle_threshold` < pi / 2. If the crossing angle is larger than this parameter, it can be a candidate for noise object. In other words, if it is smaller than this parameter, it is a filtered object.
If this parameter is set smaller, more objects are considered noise. In detail, see algorithm chapter.

- `velocity_threshold` (double) [m/s]
  - Default parameter is 3.0.

This parameter is the velocity threshold to filter. If velocity of an object is larger than this parameter, it can be a candidate for noise object. In other words, if velocity of an object is smaller than this parameter, it is a filtered object.
If this parameter is set smaller, more objects are considered noise. In detail, see algorithm chapter.
