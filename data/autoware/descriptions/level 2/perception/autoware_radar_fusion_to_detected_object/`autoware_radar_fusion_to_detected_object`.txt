This package contains a sensor fusion module for radar-detected objects and 3D detected objects.

The fusion node can:

- Attach velocity to 3D detections when successfully matching radar data. The tracking modules use the velocity information to enhance the tracking results while planning modules use it to execute actions like adaptive cruise control.
- Improve the low confidence 3D detections when corresponding radar detections are found.
