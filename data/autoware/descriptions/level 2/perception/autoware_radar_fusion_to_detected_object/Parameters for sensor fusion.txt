- `bounding_box_margin` (double) [m]
  - Default parameter is 2.0.

This parameter is the distance to extend the 2D bird's-eye view bounding box on each side.
This parameter is used as a threshold to find radar centroids falling inside the extended box.

- `split_threshold_velocity` (double) [m/s]
  - Default parameter is 5.0.

This parameter is the object's velocity threshold to decide to split for two objects from radar information.
Note that this feature is not currently implemented.

- `threshold_yaw_diff` (double) [rad]
  - Default parameter is 0.35.

This parameter is the yaw orientation threshold.
If the difference of yaw degree between from a LiDAR-based detection object and radar velocity, radar information is attached to output objects.
