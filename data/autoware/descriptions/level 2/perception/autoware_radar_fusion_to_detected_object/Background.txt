This package is the fusion with LiDAR-based 3D detection output and radar data.
LiDAR based 3D detection can estimate position and size of objects with high precision, but it cannot estimate velocity of objects.
Radar data can estimate doppler velocity of objects, but it cannot estimate position and size of objects with high precision
This fusion package is aim to fuse these characteristic data, and to estimate position, size, velocity of objects with high precision.
