The paper just says that the 2d tracking algorithm is a simple Kalman filter.
Original codes use the `top-left-corner` and `aspect ratio` and `size` as the state vector.

This is sometimes unstable because the aspect ratio can be changed by the occlusion.
So, we use the `top-left` and `size` as the state vector.

Kalman filter settings can be controlled by the parameters in `config/bytetrack_node.param.yaml`.
