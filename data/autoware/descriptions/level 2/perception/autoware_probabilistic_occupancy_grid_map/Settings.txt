Occupancy grid map is generated on `map_frame`, and grid orientation is fixed.

You may need to choose `scan_origin_frame` and `gridmap_origin_frame` which means sensor origin and gridmap origin respectively. Especially, set your main LiDAR sensor frame (e.g. `velodyne_top` in sample_vehicle) as a `scan_origin_frame` would result in better performance.
