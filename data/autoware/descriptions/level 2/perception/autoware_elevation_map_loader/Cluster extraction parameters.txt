| pcl_grid_map_extraction/cluster_extraction/cluster_tolerance | float | Distance between points below which they will still be considered part of one cluster. | 0.2           |
| pcl_grid_map_extraction/cluster_extraction/min_num_points    | int   | Min number of points that a cluster needs to have (otherwise it will be discarded).    | 3             |
