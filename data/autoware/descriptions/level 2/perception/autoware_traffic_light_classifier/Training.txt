MMPretrain offers a training script that is controlled through a configuration file.
Leveraging an inheritance design pattern, you can effortlessly tailor the training script
using Python files as configuration files.

In the example, we demonstrate the training steps on the MobileNetV2 model,
but you have the flexibility to employ alternative classification models such as
EfficientNetV2, EfficientNetV3, ResNet, and more.
