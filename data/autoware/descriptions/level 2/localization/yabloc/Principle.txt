The diagram below illustrates the basic principle of YabLoc.
It extracts road surface markings by extracting the line segments using the road area obtained from graph-based segmentation.
The red line at the center-top of the diagram represents the line segments identified as road surface markings.
YabLoc transforms these segments for each particle and determines the particle's weight by comparing them with the cost map generated from Lanelet2.
