- Running YabLoc and NDT simultaneously is not supported.
  - This is because running both at the same time may be computationally too expensive.
  - Also, in most cases, NDT is superior to YabLoc, so there is less benefit to running them at the same time.
- It does not estimate roll and pitch, therefore some of the perception nodes may not work well.
- It does not support multiple cameras now. But it will in the future.
- In places where there are few road surface markings, such as intersections, the estimation heavily relies on GNSS, IMU, and vehicle's wheel odometry.
- If the road boundary or road surface markings are not included in the Lanelet2, the estimation is likely to fail.
- The sample rosbag provided in the autoware tutorial does not include images, so it is not possible to run YabLoc with it.
  - If you want to test the functionality of YabLoc, the sample test data provided in this [PR](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.universe/pull/3946) is useful.
