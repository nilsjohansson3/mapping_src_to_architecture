The `pose_instability_detector` is a node designed to monitor the stability of `/localization/kinematic_state`, which is an output topic of the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF).

This node triggers periodic timer callbacks to compare two poses:

- The pose calculated by dead reckoning starting from the pose of `/localization/kinematic_state` obtained `timer_period` seconds ago.
- The latest pose from `/localization/kinematic_state`.

The results of this comparison are then output to the `/diagnostics` topic.

If this node outputs WARN messages to `/diagnostics`, it means that the EKF output is significantly different from the integrated twist values.
In other words, WARN outputs indicate that the vehicle has moved to a place outside the expected range based on the twist values.
This discrepancy suggests that there may be an issue with either the estimated pose or the input twist.

The following diagram provides an overview of how the procedure looks like:
