These thresholds examine the difference in the lateral and vertical axes between the two poses, and check whether the vehicle goes beyond the expected error.
The `pose_instability_detector` calculates the possible range where the vehicle goes, and get the maximum difference between the nominal dead reckoning pose and the maximum limit pose.

Addition to this, the `pose_instability_detector` node considers the pose estimation error tolerance to determine the threshold.

$$
\tau_y = l + \epsilon_y
$$

| $\tau_y$     | Threshold for the difference in the lateral axis                                                | $m$  |
| $l$          | Maximum lateral distance described in the image above (See the appendix how this is calculated) | $m$  |
| $\epsilon_y$ | Pose estimator (e. g. ndt_scan_matcher) error tolerance in the lateral axis                     | $m$  |

Note that `pose_instability_detector` sets the threshold for the vertical axis as the same as the lateral axis. Only the pose estimator error tolerance is different.
