The `pose_instability_detector` node compares the pose calculated by dead reckoning with the latest pose from the EKF output.
These two pose are ideally the same, but in reality, they are not due to the error in the twist values the pose observation.
If these two poses are significantly different so that the absolute value exceeds the threshold, the node outputs a WARN message to the `/diagnostics` topic.
There are six thresholds (x, y, z, roll, pitch, and yaw) to determine whether the poses are significantly different, and these thresholds are determined by the following subsections.
