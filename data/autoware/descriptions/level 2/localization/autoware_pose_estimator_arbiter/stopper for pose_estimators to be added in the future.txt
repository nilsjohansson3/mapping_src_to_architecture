The basic strategy is to realize ON/OFF switching by relaying the input or output topics of that pose_estimator.
If pose_estimator involves time-series processing with heavy computations, it's not possible to pause and resume with just topic relaying.

In such cases, there may not be generally applicable solutions, but the following methods may help:

1. Completely stop and **reinitialize** time-series processing, as seen in the case of YabLoc.
2. Subscribe to `localization/kinematic_state` and **keep updating states** to ensure that the estimation does not break (relying on the output of the active pose_estimator).
3. The multiple pose_estimator **does not support** that particular pose_estimator.

Please note that this issue is fundamental to realizing multiple pose_estimators, and it will arise regardless of the architecture proposed in this case.
