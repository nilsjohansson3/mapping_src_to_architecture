It is possible to launch multiple pose_estimators and fuse them using a Kalman filter by editing launch files.
However, this approach is not preferable due to computational costs.

Particularly, NDT and YabLoc are computationally intensive, and it's not recommended to run them simultaneously.
Also, even if both can be activated at the same time, the Kalman Filter may be affected by one of them giving bad output.

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, **there is ONLY A RULE implemented that always enables all pose_estimators.**
> If users want to toggle pose_estimator with their own rules, they need to add new rules. by referring to example_rule.
> The [example_rule](example_rule/README.md) has source code that can be used as a reference for implementing the rules.
