Currently, **ONLY ONE RULE** (`enable_all_rule`) is implemented.
In the future, several rules will be implemented and users will be able to select rules.

> [!TIP]
> There are presets available to extend the rules. If you want to extend the rules, please see [example_rule](./example_rule/README.md).
