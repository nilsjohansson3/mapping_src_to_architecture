When running multiple pose_estimators, autoware_pose_estimator_arbiter is executed.
It comprises a **switching rule** and **stoppers** corresponding to each pose_estimator.

- Stoppers control the pose_estimator activity by relaying inputs or outputs, or by requesting a suspend service.
- Switching rules determine which pose_estimator to use.

Which stoppers and switching rules are instantiated depends on the runtime arguments at startup.

Following figure shows the node configuration when all pose_estimator are run simultaneously.

- **NDT**

The NDT stopper relays topics in the front side of the point cloud pre-processor.

- **YabLoc**

The YabLoc stopper relays input image topics in the frontend of the image pre-processor.
YabLoc includes a particle filter process that operates on a timer, and even when image topics are not streamed, the particle prediction process continues to work.
To address this, the YabLoc stopper also has a service client for explicitly stopping and resuming YabLoc.

- **Eagleye**

The Eagleye stopper relays Eagleye's output pose topics in the backend of Eagleye's estimation process.
Eagleye performs time-series processing internally, and it can't afford to stop the input stream.
Furthermore, Eagleye's estimation process is lightweight enough to be run continuously without a significant load, so the relay is inserted in the backend.

- **ArTag**

The ArTag stopper relays image topics in the front side of the landmark localizer.
