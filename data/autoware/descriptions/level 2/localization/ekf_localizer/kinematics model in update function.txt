where, $\theta_k$ represents the vehicle's heading angle, including the mounting angle bias.
$b_k$ is a correction term for the yaw bias, and it is modeled so that $(\theta_k+b_k)$ becomes the heading angle of the base_link.
The pose_estimator is expected to publish the base_link in the map coordinate system. However, the yaw angle may be offset due to calibration errors. This model compensates this error and improves estimation accuracy.
