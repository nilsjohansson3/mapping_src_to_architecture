- If multiple pose_estimators are used, the input to the EKF will include multiple yaw biases corresponding to each source. However, the current EKF assumes the existence of only one yaw bias. Therefore, yaw bias `b_k` in the current EKF state would not make any sense and cannot correctly handle these multiple yaw biases. Thus, future work includes introducing yaw bias for each sensor with yaw estimation.
