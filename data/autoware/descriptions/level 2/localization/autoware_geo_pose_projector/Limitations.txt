The covariance conversion may be incorrect depending on the projection type you are using. The covariance of input topic is expressed in (Latitude, Longitude, Altitude) as a diagonal matrix.
Currently, we assume that the x axis is the east direction and the y axis is the north direction. Thus, the conversion may be incorrect when this assumption breaks, especially when the covariance of latitude and longitude is different.
