The definitions of the landmarks written to the map are introduced in the next section. See `Map Specifications`.

The `landmark_manager` is a utility package to load landmarks from the map.

- Translation : The center of the four vertices of the landmark
- Rotation : Let the vertex numbers be 1, 2, 3, 4 counterclockwise as shown in the next section. Direction is defined as the cross product of the vector from 1 to 2 and the vector from 2 to 3.

Users can define landmarks as Lanelet2 4-vertex polygons.
In this case, it is possible to define an arrangement in which the four vertices cannot be considered to be on the same plane. The direction of the landmark in that case is difficult to calculate.
So, if the 4 vertices are considered as forming a tetrahedron and its volume exceeds the `volume_threshold` parameter, the landmark will not publish tf_static.
