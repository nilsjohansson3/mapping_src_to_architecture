The GNSS and NDT pose topics may have different frequencies.
The GNSS pose topic may have a higher frequency than the NDT.

Let's assume that the inputs have the following frequencies:

| Source | Frequency |
| ------ | --------- |
| GNSS   | 200 Hz    |
| NDT    | 10 Hz     |

This package publishes the output poses as they come in, depending on the mode.

End result:

| Mode       | Output Freq |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| GNSS Only  | 200 Hz      |
| GNSS + NDT | 210 Hz      |
| NDT Only   | 10 Hz       |
