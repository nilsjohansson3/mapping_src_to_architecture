GNSS and NDT nodes provide the pose with covariance data utilized in an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF).

Accurate covariance values are crucial for the effectiveness of the EKF in estimating the state.

The GNSS system generates reliable standard deviation values, which can be transformed into covariance measures.

But we currently don't have a reliable way to determine the covariance values for the NDT poses.
And the NDT matching system in Autoware outputs poses with preset covariance values.

For this reason, this package is designed to manage the selection of the pose source,
based on the standard deviation values provided by the GNSS system.

It also tunes the covariance values of the NDT poses, based on the GNSS standard deviation values.
