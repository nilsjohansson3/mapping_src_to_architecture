This package takes in GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System)
and NDT (Normal Distribution Transform) poses with covariances.

It outputs a single pose with covariance:

- Directly the GNSS pose and its covariance.
- Directly the NDT pose and its covariance.
- Both GNSS and NDT poses with modified covariances.

> - This package doesn't modify the pose information it receives.
> - It only modifies NDT covariance values under certain conditions.
