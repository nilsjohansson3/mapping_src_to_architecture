- The GNSS/INS module must provide standard deviation values (its error / RMSE) for the position and orientation.
- It probably needs RTK support to provide accurate position and orientation information.
- You need to have a geo-referenced map.
- GNSS/INS module and the base_link frame must be calibrated well enough.
- In an environment where GNSS/INS and NDT systems work well, the `base_link` poses from both systems should be close to
  each other.
