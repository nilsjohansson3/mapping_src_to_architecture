This `autoware_pose2twist` calculates the velocity from the input pose history. In addition to the computed twist, this node outputs the linear-x and angular-z components as a float message to simplify debugging.

The `twist.linear.x` is calculated as `sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy + dz * dz) / dt`, and the values in the `y` and `z` fields are zero.
The `twist.angular` is calculated as `relative_rotation_vector / dt` for each field.
