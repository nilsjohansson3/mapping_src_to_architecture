Localization aims to estimate vehicle pose, velocity, and acceleration.

Goals:

- Propose a system that can estimate vehicle pose, velocity, and acceleration for as long as possible.
- Propose a system that can diagnose the stability of estimation and send a warning message to the error-monitoring system if the estimation result is unreliable.
- Design a vehicle localization function that can work with various sensor configurations.

Non-goals:

- This design document does not aim to develop a localization system that
  - is infallible in all environments
  - works outside of the pre-defined ODD (Operational Design Domain)
  - has better performance than is required for autonomous driving
