Since this function determines the base position by linear interpolation from the recently subscribed poses,
topics that are published at a low frequency relative to the driving speed cannot be used.
Inappropriate linear interpolation may result in bad optimization results.

When using GNSS for base location, the regularization can have negative effects in tunnels, indoors, and near skyscrapers.
This is because if the base position is far off from the true value, NDT scan matching may converge to inappropriate optimal position.
