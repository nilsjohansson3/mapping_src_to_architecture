There are three types in the calculation of 2D covariance in real time.You can select the method by changing covariance_estimation_type.
initial_pose_offset_model is rotated around (x,y) = (0,0) in the direction of the first principal component of the Hessian matrix.
initial_pose_offset_model_x & initial_pose_offset_model_y must have the same number of elements.
In MULTI_NDT_SCORE mode, the scale of the output 2D covariance can be adjusted according to the temperature.
