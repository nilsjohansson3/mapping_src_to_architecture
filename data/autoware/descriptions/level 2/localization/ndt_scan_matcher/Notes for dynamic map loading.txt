To use dynamic map loading feature for `ndt_scan_matcher`, you also need to split the PCD files into grids (recommended size: 20[m] x 20[m])

Note that the dynamic map loading may FAIL if the map is split into two or more large size map (e.g. 1000[m] x 1000[m]). Please provide either of

- one PCD map file
- multiple PCD map files divided into small size (~20[m])

Here is a split PCD map for `sample-map-rosbag` from Autoware tutorial: [`sample-map-rosbag_split.zip`](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.universe/files/10349104/sample-map-rosbag_split.zip)

|   PCD files    | How NDT loads map(s) |

|  single file   |  at once (standard)  |
| multiple files |     dynamically      |
