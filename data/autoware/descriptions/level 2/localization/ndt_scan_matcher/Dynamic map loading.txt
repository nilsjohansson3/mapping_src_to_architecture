Autoware supports dynamic map loading feature for `ndt_scan_matcher`. Using this feature, NDT dynamically requests for the surrounding pointcloud map to `pointcloud_map_loader`, and then receive and preprocess the map in an online fashion.

Using the feature, `ndt_scan_matcher` can theoretically handle any large size maps in terms of memory usage. (Note that it is still possible that there exists a limitation due to other factors, e.g. floating-point error)
