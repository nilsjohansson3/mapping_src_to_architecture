Initially, the covariance of NDT scan matching is a fixed value(FIXED_VALUE mode).
So, three modes are provided for 2D covariance (xx, xy, yx, yy) estimation in real time: LAPLACE_APPROXIMATION, MULTI_NDT, and MULTI_NDT_SCORE.
LAPLACE_APPROXIMATION calculates the inverse matrix of the XY (2x2) part of the Hessian obtained by NDT scan matching and uses it as the covariance matrix.
On the other hand, MULTI_NDT, and MULTI_NDT_SCORE use NDT convergence from multiple initial poses to obtain 2D covariance.
Ideally, the arrangement of multiple initial poses is efficiently limited by the Hessian matrix of the NDT score function.
In this implementation, the number of initial positions is fixed to simplify the code.
To obtain the covariance, MULTI_NDT computes until convergence at each initial position, while MULTI_NDT_SCORE uses the nearest voxel transformation likelihood.
The covariance can be seen as error ellipse from ndt_pose_with_covariance setting on rviz2.

Note that this function may spoil healthy system behavior if it consumes much calculation resources.
