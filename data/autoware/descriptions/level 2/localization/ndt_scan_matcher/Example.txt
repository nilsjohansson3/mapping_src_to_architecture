The following figures show tested maps.

- The left is a map with enough features that NDT can successfully localize.
- The right is a map with so few features that the NDT cannot localize well.

The following figures show the trajectories estimated on the feature-less map with standard NDT and regularization-enabled NDT, respectively.
The color of the trajectory indicates the error (meter) from the reference trajectory, which is computed with the feature-rich map.

- The left figure shows that the pure NDT causes a longitudinal error in the bridge and is not able to recover.
- The right figure shows that the regularization suppresses the longitudinal error.
