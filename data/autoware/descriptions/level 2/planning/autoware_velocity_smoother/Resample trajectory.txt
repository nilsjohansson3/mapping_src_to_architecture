It resamples the points on the reference trajectory with designated time interval.
Note that the range of the length of the trajectory is set between `min_trajectory_length` and `max_trajectory_length`, and the distance between two points is longer than `min_trajectory_interval_distance`.
It samples densely up to the distance traveled between `resample_time` with the current velocity, then samples sparsely after that.
By sampling according to the velocity, both calculation load and accuracy are achieved since it samples finely at low velocity and coarsely at high velocity.
