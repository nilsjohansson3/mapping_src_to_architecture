It applies the velocity limit input from the external of `autoware_velocity_smoother`.
Remark that the external velocity limit is different from the velocity limit already set on the map and the reference trajectory.
The external velocity is applied at the position that it is able to reach the velocity limit with the deceleration and the jerk constraints set as the parameter.
