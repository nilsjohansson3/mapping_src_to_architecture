Calculate initial values for velocity planning.
The initial values are calculated according to the situation as shown in the following table.

| Situation                                                     | Initial velocity       | Initial acceleration   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| First calculation                                             | Current velocity       | 0.0                    |
| Engaging                                                      | `engage_velocity`      | `engage_acceleration`  |
| Deviate between the planned velocity and the current velocity | Current velocity       | Previous planned value |
| Normal                                                        | Previous planned value | Previous planned value |
