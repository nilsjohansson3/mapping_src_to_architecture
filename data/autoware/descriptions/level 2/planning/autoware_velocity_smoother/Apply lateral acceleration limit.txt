It applies the velocity limit to decelerate at the curve.
It calculates the velocity limit from the curvature of the reference trajectory and the maximum lateral acceleration `max_lateral_accel`.
The velocity limit is set as not to fall under `min_curve_velocity`.

Note: velocity limit that requests larger than `nominal.jerk` is not applied. In other words, even if a sharp curve is planned just in front of the ego, no deceleration is performed.
