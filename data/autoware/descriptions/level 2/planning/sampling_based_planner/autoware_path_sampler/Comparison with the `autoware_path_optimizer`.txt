The `autoware_path_optimizer` uses an optimization based approach,
finding the optimal solution of a mathematical problem if it exists.
When no solution can be found, it is often hard to identify the issue due to the intermediate mathematical representation of the problem.

In comparison, the sampling based approach cannot guarantee an optimal solution but is much more straightforward,
making it easier to debug and tune.
