The current implementation has introduced a scenario-level switching logic as a method for collectively switching multiple modules. This allows for the addition of new scenarios (e.g., highway driving).

By creating a scenario as a ros node and aligning the scenario_selector ros node with it, the integration is complete. The benefit of this is that you can introduce significant new functionalities without affecting the implementation of other scenarios (like Lane Driving). However, it only allows for scenario-level coordination through scenario switching and does not enable coordination at the existing planning module level.
