In each node of the planning module, when exceptional input, such as unusual routes or significantly deviated ego-position, is given, the node may not be prepared for such input and could crash. As a result, debugging node crashes can be time-consuming. For example, if an empty trajectory is given as input and it was not anticipated during implementation, the node might crash due to the unaddressed exceptional input when changes are merged, during scenario testing or while the system is running on an actual vehicle.
