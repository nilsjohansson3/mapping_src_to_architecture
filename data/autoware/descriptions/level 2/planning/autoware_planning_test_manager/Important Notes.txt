During test execution, when launching a node, parameters are loaded from the parameter file within each package. Therefore, when adding parameters, it is necessary to add the required parameters to the parameter file in the target node package. This is to prevent the node from being unable to launch if there are missing parameters when retrieving them from the parameter file during node launch.
