If it needs X meters (e.g. 0.5 meters) to stop once the vehicle starts moving due to the poor vehicle control
performance, the vehicle goes over the stopping position that should be strictly observed when the vehicle starts to
moving in order to approach the near stop point (e.g. 0.3 meters away).

This module has parameter `hold_stop_margin_distance` in order to prevent from these redundant restart. If the vehicle
is stopped within `hold_stop_margin_distance` meters from stop point of the module, the module judges that the vehicle
has already stopped for the module's stop point and plans to keep stopping current position even if the vehicle is
stopped due to other factors.
