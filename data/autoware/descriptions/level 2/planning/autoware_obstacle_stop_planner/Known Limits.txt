- It is strongly depends on velocity planning module whether or not it moves according to the target speed embedded
  by `Adaptive Cruise Controller` module. If the velocity planning module is updated, please take care of the vehicle's
  behavior as much as possible and always be ready for overriding.

- The velocity estimation algorithm in `Adaptive Cruise Controller` is depend on object tracking module. Please note
  that if the object-tracking fails or the tracking result is incorrect, it the possibility that the vehicle behaves
  dangerously.

- It does not work for backward driving, but publishes the path of the input as it is. Please
  use [obstacle_cruise_planner](../autoware_obstacle_cruise_planner/README.md) if you want to stop against an obstacle when
  backward driving.
