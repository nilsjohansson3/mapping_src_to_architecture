- The remaining distance calculation is based on getting the remaining shortest path between the current vehicle pose and goal pose using `lanelet2` routing APIs.
- The remaining distance is calculated by summing the 2D length of remaining shortest path, with exception to current lanelet and goal lanelet.
  - For the current lanelet, the distance is calculated from the current vehicle position to the end of that lanelet.
  - For the goal lanelet, the distance is calculated from the start of the lanelet to the goal pose in this lanelet.
- When there is only one lanelet remaining, the distance is calculated by getting the 2D distance between the current vehicle pose and goal pose.
- Checks are added to handle cases when current lanelet, goal lanelet, or routing graph are not valid to prevent node process die.
  - In such cases when, last valid remaining distance and time are maintained.
