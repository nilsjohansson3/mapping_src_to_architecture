When one of the following conditions are met, trajectory optimization will be executed.
Otherwise, previously optimized trajectory is used with updating the velocity from the latest input path.

max_path_shape_around_ego_lat_dist

- Ego moves longer than `replan.max_ego_moving_dist` in one cycle. (default: 3.0 [m])
  - This is for when the ego pose is set again in the simulation.
- Trajectory's end, which is considered as the goal pose, moves longer than `replan.max_goal_moving_dist` in one cycle. (default: 15.0 [ms])
  - When the goal pose is set again, the planning should be reset.
- Time passes. (default: 1.0 [s])
  - The optimization is skipped for a while sine the optimization is sometimes heavy.
- The input path changes laterally longer than `replan.max_path_shape_around_ego_lat_dist` in one cycle. (default: 2.0)
