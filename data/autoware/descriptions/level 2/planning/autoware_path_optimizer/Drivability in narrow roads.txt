- modify `mpt.clearance.soft_clearance_from_road`
  - This parameter describes how much margin to make between the trajectory and road boundaries.
  - Due to the model error for optimization, the constraint such as collision-free is not fully met.
    - By making this parameter larger, the is for narrow-road driving may be resolved. 12180
- modify `mpt.kinematics.optimization_center_offset`

  - The point on the vehicle, offset forward with this parameter from the base link` tries to follow the reference path.

- change or tune the method to approximate footprints with a set of circles.
  - See [here](https://autowarefoundation.github.io/autoware.universe/main/planning/path_optimizer/docs/mpt/collision-free)
  - Tuning means changing the ratio of circle's radius.
