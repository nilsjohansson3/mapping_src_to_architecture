Optimized trajectory is too short for velocity planning, therefore extend the trajectory by concatenating the optimized trajectory and the behavior path considering drivability.
Generated trajectory is checked if it is inside the drivable area or not, and if outside drivable area, output a trajectory inside drivable area with the behavior path or the previously generated trajectory.

As described above, the behavior path is separated into two paths: one is for optimization and the other is the remain. The first path becomes optimized trajectory, and the second path just is transformed to a trajectory. Then a trajectory inside the drivable area is calculated as follows.

- If optimized trajectory is **inside the drivable area**, and the remained trajectory is inside/outside the drivable area,
  - the output trajectory will be just concatenation of those two trajectories.
  - In this case, we do not care if the remained trajectory is inside or outside the drivable area since generally it is outside the drivable area (especially in a narrow road), but we want to pass a trajectory as long as possible to the latter module.
- If optimized trajectory is **outside the drivable area**, and the remained trajectory is inside/outside the drivable area,
  - and if the previously generated trajectory **is memorized**,
    - the output trajectory will be the previously generated trajectory, where zero velocity is inserted to the point firstly going outside the drivable area.
  - and if the previously generated trajectory **is not memorized**,
    - the output trajectory will be a part of trajectory just transformed from the behavior path, where zero velocity is inserted to the point firstly going outside the drivable area.

Optimization failure is dealt with the same as if the optimized trajectory is outside the drivable area.
The output trajectory is memorized as a previously generated trajectory for the next cycle.

_Rationale_
In the current design, since there are some modelling errors, the constraints are considered to be soft constraints.
Therefore, we have to make sure that the optimized trajectory is inside the drivable area or not after optimization.
