Trajectory planning problem that satisfies kinematically-feasibility and collision-free has two main characteristics that makes hard to be solved: one is non-convex and the other is high dimension.
Based on the characteristics, we investigate pros/cons of the typical planning methods: optimization-based, sampling-based, and learning-based method.
