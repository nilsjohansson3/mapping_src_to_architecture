Route section, whose type is `autoware_planning_msgs/LaneletSegment`, is a "slice" of a road that bundles lane changeable lanes.
Note that the most atomic unit of route is `autoware_planning_msgs/LaneletPrimitive`, which has the unique id of a lane in a vector map and its type.
Therefore, route message does not contain geometric information about the lane since we did not want to have planning moduleâ€™s message to have dependency on map data structure.

The ROS message of route section contains following three elements for each route section.

- `preferred_primitive`: Preferred lane to follow towards the goal.
- `primitives`: All neighbor lanes in the same direction including the preferred lane.
