- The safety judgment of rerouting is not guaranteed to the level of trajectory or control. Therefore, the distance to the reroute change must be large for the safety.
- The validity of the `modified_goal` needs to be guaranteed by the behavior_path_planner, e.g., that it is not placed in the wrong lane, that it can be safely rerouted, etc.
