- Get no_drivable_lane attribute on the path from lanelet2 map
- The no drivable lane state machine starts in `INIT` state
- Get the intersection points between path and no drivable lane polygon
- Assign the state to `APPROACHING` toward a no drivable lane if:
  - the distance from front of the ego vehicle till the first intersection point between the ego path and the no drivable lane polygon is more than the `stop_margin`
- Assign the state to `INSIDE_NO_DRIVABLE_LANE` if:
  - the first point of the ego path is inside the no drivable lane polygon, or
  - the distance from front of the ego vehicle till the first intersection point between the ego path and the no drivable lane polygon is less than the `stop_margin`
- Assign the state to `STOPPED` when the vehicle is completely stopped
