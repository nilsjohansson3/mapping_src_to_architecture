This module plans the velocity of the related part of the path in case there is a no drivable lane referring to it.

A no drivable lane is a lanelet or more that are out of operation design domain (ODD), i.e., the vehicle **must not** drive autonomously in this lanelet.  
A lanelet can be no drivable (out of ODD) due to many reasons, either technical limitations of the SW and/or HW, business requirements, safety considerations, .... etc, or even a combination of those.

Some examples of No Drivable Lanes

- Closed road intentionally, due to construction work for example
- Underpass road that goes under a railway, for safety reasons
- Road with slope/inclination that the vehicle is not be able to drive autonomously due to technical limitations. And lots of other examples.

A lanelet becomes invalid by adding a new tag under the relevant lanelet in the map file `<tag k="no_drivable_lane" v="yes"/>`.

The target of this module is to stop the vehicle before entering the no drivable lane (with configurable stop margin) or keep the vehicle stationary if autonomous mode started inside a no drivable lane. Then ask the human driver to take the responsibility of the driving task (Takeover Request / Request to Intervene)
