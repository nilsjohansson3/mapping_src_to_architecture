There are several types of occlusions, such as "occlusions generated by parked vehicles" and "occlusions caused by obstructions". In situations such as driving on **road with obstacles**, where people jump out of the way frequently, all possible occlusion spots must be taken into account. This module considers all occlusion spots calculated from the **occupancy grid**, but it is not reasonable to take into account all occlusion spots for example, people jumping out from behind a guardrail, or behind cruising vehicle. Therefore currently detection area will be limited to to use **predicted object** information.

Note that this decision logic is still under development and needs to be improved.
