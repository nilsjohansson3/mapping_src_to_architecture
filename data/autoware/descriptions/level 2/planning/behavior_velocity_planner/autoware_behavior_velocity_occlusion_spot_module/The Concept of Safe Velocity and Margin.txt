The safe slowdown velocity is calculated from the below parameters of ego emergency braking system and time to collision.
Below calculation is included but change velocity dynamically is not recommended for planner.

- jerk limit[m/s^3]
- deceleration limit[m/s2]
- delay response time[s]
- time to collision of pedestrian[s]
  with these parameters we can briefly define safe motion before occlusion spot for ideal environment.

  ![occupancy_grid](./docs/safe_motion.drawio.svg)

This module defines safe margin to consider ego distance to stop and collision path point geometrically.
While ego is cruising from safe margin to collision path point, ego vehicle keeps the same velocity as occlusion spot safe velocity.

![brief](./docs/behavior_after_safe_margin.drawio.svg)

Note: This logic assumes high-precision vehicle speed tracking and margin for decel point might not be the best solution, and override with manual driver is considered if pedestrian really run out from occlusion spot.

TODO: consider one of the best choices

1. stop in front of occlusion spot
2. insert 1km/h velocity in front of occlusion spot
3. slowdown this way
4. etc... .
