This module considers TTV from pedestrian velocity and lateral distance to occlusion spot.
TTC is calculated from ego velocity and acceleration and longitudinal distance until collision point using motion velocity smoother.
To compute fast this module only consider occlusion spot whose TTV is less than TTC and only consider area within "max lateral distance".
