This module considers any occlusion spot around ego path computed from the occupancy grid.
Due to the computational cost occupancy grid is not high resolution and this will make occupancy grid noisy so this module add information of occupancy to occupancy grid map.

TODO: consider hight of obstacle point cloud to generate occupancy grid.
