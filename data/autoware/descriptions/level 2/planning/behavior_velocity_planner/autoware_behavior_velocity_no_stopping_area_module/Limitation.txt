This module allows developers to design vehicle velocity in `no_stopping_area` module using specific rules. Once ego vehicle go through pass through point, ego vehicle does't insert stop velocity and does't change decision from GO. Also this module only considers dynamic object in order to avoid unnecessarily stop.
