Sets a stop line, a pass judge line, a detection area and conflict area based on a map information and a self position.

- Stop line : Automatically created based on crossing lane information.

- Pass judge line : A position to judge if stop or not to avoid a rapid brake.

- Detection area : Right/left side area of the self position.

- Conflict area : Right/left side area from the self position to the stop line.

Stop/Go state: When both conditions are met for any of each object, this module state is transited to the "stop" state and insert zero velocity to stop the vehicle.

- Object is on the detection area
- Object’s predicted path is on the conflict area

In order to avoid a rapid stop, the “stop” judgement is not executed after the judgment line is passed.

Once a "stop" is judged, it will not transit to the "go" state until the "go" judgment continues for a certain period in order to prevent chattering of the state (e.g. 2 seconds).
