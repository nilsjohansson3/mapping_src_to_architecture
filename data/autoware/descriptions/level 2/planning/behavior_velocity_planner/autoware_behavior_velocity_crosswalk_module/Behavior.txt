- Q. The ego stopped around the crosswalk even though there were no crosswalk user objects.
  - A. See [Stuck Vehicle Detection](https://autowarefoundation.github.io/autoware.universe/pr-5583/planning/autoware_behavior_velocity_crosswalk_module/stuck-vehicle-detection).
- Q. The crosswalk virtual wall suddenly appeared resulting in the sudden stop.
  - A. There may be a crosswalk user started moving when the ego was close to the crosswalk.
- Q. The crosswalk module decides to stop even when the pedestrian traffic light is red.
  - A. The lanelet map may be incorrect. The pedestrian traffic light and the crosswalk have to be related.
- Q. In the planning simulation, the crosswalk module does the yield decision to stop on all the crosswalks.
  - A. This is because the pedestrian traffic light is unknown by default. In this case, the crosswalk does the yield decision for safety.
