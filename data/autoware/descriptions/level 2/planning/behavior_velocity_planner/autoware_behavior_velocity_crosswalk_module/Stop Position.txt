First of all, `stop_distance_from_object [m]` is always kept at least between the ego and the target object for safety.

When the stop line exists in the lanelet map, the stop position is calculated based on the line.
When the stop line does **NOT** exist in the lanelet map, the stop position is calculated by keeping `stop_distance_from_crosswalk [m]` between the ego and the crosswalk.

        </tr>
    </table>
</div>

As an exceptional case, if a pedestrian (or bicycle) is crossing **wide** crosswalks seen in scramble intersections, and the pedestrian position is more than `far_object_threshold` meters away from the stop line, the actual stop position is determined by `stop_distance_from_object` and pedestrian position, not at the stop line.

In the `stop_position` namespace, the following parameters are defined.

| Parameter                      |     | Type   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------ | --- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `stop_position_threshold`      | [m] | double | If the ego vehicle has stopped near the stop line than this value, this module assumes itself to have achieved yielding.                                                                                                  |

| `far_object_threshold`         | [m] | double | If objects cross X meters behind the stop line, the stop position is determined according to the object position (stop_distance_from_object meters before the object) for the case where the crosswalk width is very wide |
| `stop_distance_from_object`    | [m] | double | the vehicle decelerates to be able to stop in front of object with margin                                                                                                                                                 |
