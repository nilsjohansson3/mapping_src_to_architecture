The feature will make the ego not to stop on the crosswalk.
When there is a low-speed or stopped vehicle ahead of the crosswalk, and there is not enough space between the crosswalk and the vehicle, the crosswalk module plans to stop before the crosswalk even if there are no pedestrians or bicycles.

`min_acc`, `min_jerk`, and `max_jerk` are met. If the ego cannot stop before the crosswalk with these parameters, the stop position will move forward.

In the `stuck_vehicle` namespace, the following parameters are defined.

| Parameter                          | Unit    | Type   | Description                                                             |
| ---------------------------------- | ------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `stuck_vehicle_velocity`           | [m/s]   | double | maximum velocity threshold whether the target vehicle is stopped or not |
| `max_stuck_vehicle_lateral_offset` | [m]     | double | maximum lateral offset of the target vehicle position                   |
| `required_clearance`               | [m]     | double | clearance to be secured between the ego and the ahead vehicle           |
| `min_acc`                          | [m/ss]  | double | minimum acceleration to stop                                            |
| `min_jerk`                         | [m/sss] | double | minimum jerk to stop                                                    |
| `max_jerk`                         | [m/sss] | double | maximum jerk to stop                                                    |
