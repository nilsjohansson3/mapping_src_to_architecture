Due to the perception's limited performance where the tree or poll is recognized as a pedestrian or the tracking failure in the crowd or occlusion, even if the surrounding environment does not change, the new pedestrian (= the new ID's pedestrian) may suddenly appear unexpectedly.
If this happens while the ego is going to pass the crosswalk, the ego will stop suddenly.

To deal with this issue, the option `disable_yield_for_new_stopped_object` is prepared.
If true is set, the yield decisions around the crosswalk with a traffic light will ignore the new stopped object.

In the `pass_judge` namespace, the following parameters are defined.

| Parameter                              |     | Type | Description                                                                                      |
| -------------------------------------- | --- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `disable_yield_for_new_stopped_object` | [-] | bool | If set to true, the new stopped object will be ignored around the crosswalk with a traffic light |
