This feature makes ego slow down for a crosswalk that is occluded.

Occlusion of the crosswalk is determined using the occupancy grid.
An occlusion is a square of size `min_size` of occluded cells
(i.e., their values are between `free_space_max` and `occupied_min`)
of size `min_size`.
If an occlusion is found within range of the crosswalk,
then the velocity limit at the crosswalk is set to `slow_down_velocity` (or more to not break limits set by `max_slow_down_jerk` and `max_slow_down_accel`).
The range is calculated from the intersection between the ego path and the crosswalk and is equal to the time taken by ego to reach the crosswalk times the `occluded_object_velocity`.
This range is meant to be large when ego is far from the crosswalk and small when ego is close.

In order to avoid flickering decisions, a time buffer can be used such that the decision to add (or remove) the slow down is only taken
after an occlusion is detected (or not detected) for a consecutive time defined by the `time_buffer` parameter.

To ignore occlusions when the crosswalk has a traffic light, `ignore_with_traffic_light` should be set to true.

To ignore temporary occlusions caused by moving objects,
`ignore_behind_predicted_objects` should be set to true.
By default, occlusions behind an object with velocity higher than `ignore_velocity_thresholds.default` are ignored.
This velocity threshold can be specified depending on the object type by specifying the object class label and velocity threshold in the parameter lists `ignore_velocity_thresholds.custom_labels` and `ignore_velocity_thresholds.custom_thresholds`.
To inflate the masking behind objects, their footprint can be made bigger using `extra_predicted_objects_size`.
