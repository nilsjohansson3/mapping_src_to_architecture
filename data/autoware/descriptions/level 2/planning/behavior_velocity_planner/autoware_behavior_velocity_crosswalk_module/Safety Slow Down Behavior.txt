In the current autoware implementation, if no target object is detected around a crosswalk, the ego vehicle will not slow down for the crosswalk.
However, it may be desirable to slow down in situations, for example, where there are blind spots.
Such a situation can be handled by setting some tags to the related crosswalk as instructed in the [lanelet2_format_extension.md](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware_lanelet2_extension/blob/main/autoware_lanelet2_extension/docs/lanelet2_format_extension.md)
document.

| `slow_velocity`       | [m/s]   | double | target vehicle velocity when module receive slow down command from FOA                                                |
| `max_slow_down_jerk`  | [m/sss] | double | minimum jerk deceleration for safe brake                                                                              |

| `no_relax_velocity`   | [m/s]   | double | if the current velocity is less than X m/s, ego always stops at the stop position(not relax deceleration constraints) |
