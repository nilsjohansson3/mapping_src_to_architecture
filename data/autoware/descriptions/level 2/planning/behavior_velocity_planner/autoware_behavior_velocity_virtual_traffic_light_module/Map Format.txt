- To avoid sudden braking, the length between the start line and stop line of a virtual traffic light must be longer than $l_{\mathrm{min}}$ calculated as follows, assuming that $v_0$ is the velocity when passing the start line and $a_{\mathrm{min}}$ is minimum acceleration defined in Autoware.

$$
\begin{align}
l_{\mathrm{min}} = -\frac{v_0^2}{2 a_{\mathrm{min}}}
\end{align}
