Autonomous vehicles have to cooperate with the infrastructures such as:

- Warehouse shutters
- Traffic lights with V2X support
- Communication devices at intersections
- Fleet Management Systems (FMS)

The following items are example cases:

1. Traffic control by traffic lights with V2X support

2. Intersection coordination of multiple vehicles by FMS.

It's possible to make each function individually, however, the use cases can be generalized with these three elements.

1. `start`: Start a cooperation procedure after the vehicle enters a certain zone.
2. `stop`: Stop at a defined stop line according to the status received from infrastructures.
3. `end`: Finalize the cooperation procedure after the vehicle reaches the exit zone. This should be done within the range of stable communication.

This module sends/receives status from infrastructures and plans the velocity of the cooperation result.
