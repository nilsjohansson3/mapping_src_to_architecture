Calculate the expected target velocity for the ego vehicle path to calculate time to collision with obstacles more precisely.
The expected target velocity is calculated with [autoware velocity smoother module](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.universe/tree/main/planning/autoware_velocity_smoother) by using current velocity, current acceleration and velocity limits directed by the map and external API.
