If you select the method of `Points` or `ObjectWithoutPath`, sometimes ego keeps stopping in front of the obstacle.
To avoid this problem, This feature has option to approach the obstacle with slow velocity after stopping.
If the parameter of `approaching.enable` is set to true, ego will approach the obstacle after ego stopped for `state.stop_time_thresh` seconds.
The maximum velocity of approaching can be specified by the parameter of `approaching.limit_vel_kmph`.
The decision to approach the obstacle is determined by a simple state transition as following image.

title State transition for approaching the obstacle

[*] --> GO
GO --> STOP : Current velocity is less than threshold
STOP --> GO : Current velocity is larger than threshold

STOP --> APPROACH : Stop duration is larger than threshold
APPROACH --> GO : There are no obstacles or \n distance to the obstacle is larger than threshold
APPROACH --> APPROACH : Approach duration is less than threshold
