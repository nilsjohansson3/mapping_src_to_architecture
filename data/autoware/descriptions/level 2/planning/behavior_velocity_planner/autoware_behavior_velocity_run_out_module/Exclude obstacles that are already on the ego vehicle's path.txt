In the cases were an obstacle is already on the ego vehicle's path, it cannot "cut in" into the ego's path anymore (which is the situation this module tries to handle) so it might be useful to exclude obstacles already on the vehicle's footprint path. By setting the parameter `exclude_obstacles_already_in_path` to true, this module will exclude the obstacles that are considered to be already on the ego vehicle's path for more than `keep_obstacle_on_path_time_threshold`. The module considers the ego vehicle's closest path point to each obstacle's current position, and determines the lateral distance between the obstacle and the right and left sides of the ego vehicle. If the obstacle is located within the left and right extremes of the vehicle for that pose, then it is considered to be inside the ego vehicle's footprint path and it is excluded. The virtual width of the vehicle used to detect if an obstacle is within the path or not, can be adjusted by the `ego_footprint_extra_margin` parameter.
