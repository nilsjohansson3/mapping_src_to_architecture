This module can exclude the obstacles outside of partition such as guardrail, fence, and wall.
We need lanelet map that has the information of partition to use this feature.
By this feature, we can reduce unnecessary deceleration by obstacles that are unlikely to jump out to the lane.
You can choose whether to use this feature by parameter of `use_partition_lanelet`.
