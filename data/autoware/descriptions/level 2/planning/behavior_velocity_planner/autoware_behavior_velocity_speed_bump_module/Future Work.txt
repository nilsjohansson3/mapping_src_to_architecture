- In an article [here](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1155/2014/736576), a bump modeling method
  is proposed. Simply it is based on fitting the bump in a circle and a radius calculation is done
  with it. Although the velocity calculation is based on just the height of the bump in the recent
  implementation, applying this method is intended in the future which will yield more realistic
  results.
