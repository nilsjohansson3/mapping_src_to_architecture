- Get speed bump regulatory element on the path from lanelet2 map
- Calculate `slow_down_speed` wrt to `speed_bump_height` specified in regulatory element or
  read `slow_down_speed` tag from speed bump annotation if available

![speed_bump_vel_calc](docs/speed_bump_vel_calc.png)

**Note:** If in speed bump annotation `slow_down_speed` tag is used then calculating the speed wrt
the speed bump height will be ignored. In such case, specified `slow_down_speed` value in **[kph]**
is being used.

- Get the intersection points between path and speed bump polygon
- Calculate `slow_start_point` & `slow_end_point` wrt the intersection points and insert them to
  path
- If `slow_start_point` or `slow_end_point` can not be inserted with given/calculated offset values
  check if any path point can be virtually assigned as `slow_start_point` or `slow_end_point`

- Assign `slow_down_speed` to the path points between `slow_start_point` or `slow_end_point`
