This algorithm is based on `segment`.
`segment` consists of two node points. It's useful for removing boundary conditions because if `segment(i)` exists we can assume `node(i)` and `node(i+1)` exist.

First, this algorithm finds a collision between reference path and stop line.
Then, we can get `collision segment` and `collision point`.

![find_collision_segment](docs/./find_collision_segment.drawio.svg)

Next, based on `collision point`, it finds `offset segment` by iterating backward points up to a specific offset length.
The offset length is `stop_margin`(parameter) + `base_link to front`(to adjust head pose to stop line).
Then, we can get `offset segment` and `offset from segment start`.

![find_offset_segment](docs/./find_offset_segment.drawio.svg)

After that, we can calculate a offset point from `offset segment` and `offset`. This will be `stop_pose`.
