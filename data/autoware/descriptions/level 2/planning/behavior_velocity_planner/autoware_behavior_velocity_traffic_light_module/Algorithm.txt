1. Obtains a traffic light mapped to the route and a stop line correspond to the traffic light from a map information.

   - If a corresponding traffic light signal have never been found, it treats as a signal to pass.

   - If a corresponding traffic light signal is found but timed out, it treats as a signal to stop.

2. Uses the highest reliability one of the traffic light recognition result and if the color of that was not green or corresponding arrow signal, generates a stop point.

   - If an elapsed time to receive stop signal is less than `stop_time_hysteresis`, it treats as a signal to pass. This feature is to prevent chattering.

3. When vehicle current velocity is

   - higher than 2.0m/s ⇒ pass judge(using next slide formula)

   - lower than 2.0m/s ⇒ stop

4. When it to be judged that vehicle can’t stop before stop line, autoware chooses one of the following behaviors

   - "can pass through" stop line during yellow lamp => pass

   - "can’t pass through" stop line during yellow lamp => emergency stop
