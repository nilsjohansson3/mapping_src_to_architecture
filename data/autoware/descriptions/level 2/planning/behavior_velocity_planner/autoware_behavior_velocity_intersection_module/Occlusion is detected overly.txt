You can check which areas are detected as occlusion by visualizing `/planning/scenario_planning/lane_driving/behavior_planning/behavior_velocity_planner/debug/intersection/occlusion_polygons`.

If you do not want to detect / do want to ignore occlusion far from ego or lower the computational cost of occlusion detection, `occlusion.occlusion_attention_area_length` should be set to lower value.

If you want to care the occlusion nearby ego more cautiously, set `occlusion.occlusion_required_clearance_distance` to a larger value. Then ego will approach the occlusion_peeking_stopline more closely to assure more clear FOV.

`occlusion.possible_object_bbox` is used for checking if detected occlusion area is small enough that no vehicles larger than this size can exist inside. By decreasing this size ego will ignore small occluded area.
