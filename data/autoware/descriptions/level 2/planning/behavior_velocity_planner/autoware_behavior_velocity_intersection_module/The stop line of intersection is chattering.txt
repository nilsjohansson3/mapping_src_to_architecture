The parameter `collision_detection.collision_detection_hold_time` suppresses the chattering by keeping UNSAFE decision for this duration until SAFE decision is finally made. The role of this parameter is to account for unstable detection/tracking of objects. By increasing this value you can suppress the chattering. However it could elongate the stopping duration excessively.

If the chattering arises from the acceleration/deceleration of target vehicles, increase `collision_detection.collision_detection.collision_end_margin_time` and/or `collision_detection.collision_detection.collision_end_margin_time`.
