If the traffic light color changed to GREEN and ego approached the entry of the intersection lane within the distance `collision_detection.yield_on_green_traffic_light.distance_to_assigned_lanelet_start` and there is any object whose distance to its stopline is less than `collision_detection.yield_on_green_traffic_light.object_dist_to_stopline`, this module commands to stop for the duration of `collision_detection.yield_on_green_traffic_light.duration` at default_stopline.
