- The HDMap needs to have the information of turn_direction tag (which should be one of straight, left, right) for all the lanes in intersections and right_of_way tag for specific lanes (refer to [RightOfWay](how-towhy-set-rightofway-tag) section for more details). See [autoware_lanelet2_extension document](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware_lanelet2_extension/blob/main/autoware_lanelet2_extension/docs/lanelet2_format_extension.md) for more detail.
