There are several behaviors depending on the scene.

| behavior                 | scene                                                                                             | action                                                                              |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Safe                     | Ego detected no occlusion and collision                                                           | Ego passes the intersection                                                         |
| StuckStop                | The exit of the intersection is blocked by traffic jam                                            | Ego stops before the intersection or the boundary of attention area                 |
| YieldStuck               | Another vehicle stops to yield ego                                                                | Ego stops before the intersection or the boundary of attention area                 |
| NonOccludedCollisionStop | Ego detects no occlusion but detects collision                                                    | Ego stops at default_stopline                                                       |
| FirstWaitBeforeOcclusion | Ego detected occlusion when entering the intersection                                             | Ego stops at default_stopline at first                                              |
| PeekingTowardOcclusion   | Ego detected occlusion and but no collision within the FOV (after FirstWaitBeforeOcclusion)       | Ego approaches the boundary of the attention area slowly                            |
| OccludedCollisionStop    | Ego detected both occlusion and collision (after FirstWaitBeforeOcclusion)                        | Ego stops immediately                                                               |
| FullyPrioritized         | Ego is fully prioritized by the RED/Arrow signal                                                  | Ego only cares vehicles still running inside the intersection. Occlusion is ignored |
| OverPassJudgeLine        | Ego is already inside the attention area and/or cannot stop before the boundary of attention area | Ego does not detect collision/occlusion anymore and passes the intersection         |
