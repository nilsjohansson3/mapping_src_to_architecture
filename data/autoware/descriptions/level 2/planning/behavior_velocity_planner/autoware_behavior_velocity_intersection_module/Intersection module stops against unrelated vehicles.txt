In this case, first visualize `/planning/scenario_planning/lane_driving/behavior_planning/behavior_velocity_planner/debug/intersection` topic and check the `attention_area` polygon. Intersection module performs collision checking for vehicles running on this polygon, so if it extends to unintended lanes, it needs to have [RightOfWay tag](how-towhy-set-rightofway-tag).

By lowering `common.attention_area_length` you can check which lanes are conflicting with the intersection lane. Then set part of the conflicting lanes as the yield_lane.
