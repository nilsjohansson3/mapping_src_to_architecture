Refer to the document of [autoware_probabilistic_occupancy_grid_map](https://autowarefoundation.github.io/autoware.universe/main/perception/autoware_probabilistic_occupancy_grid_map/) for details. If occlusion tends to be detected at apparently free space, increase `occlusion.free_space_max` to ignore them.
