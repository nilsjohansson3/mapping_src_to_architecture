Each stop lines are generated from interpolated path points to obtain precise positions.

```plantuml
@startuml
entity IntersectionStopLines {
  * closest_idx: size_t
  closest path point index for ego
  --
  * stuck_stopline: size_t
  stop line index on stuck vehicle detection
  --
  * default_stopline: size_t
  If defined on the map, its index on the path. Otherwise generated before first_attention_stopline
  --
  * first_attention_stopline
  The index of the first path point which is inside the attention area
  --
  * occlusion_peeking_stopline
  The index of the path point for the peeking limit position
  --
  * pass_judge_line
  The index of the path point which is before first_attention_stopline/occlusion_peeking_stopline by braking distance
}
