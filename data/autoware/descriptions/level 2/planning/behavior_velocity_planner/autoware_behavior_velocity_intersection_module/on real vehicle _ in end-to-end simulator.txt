On real vehicle or in end-to-end simulator like [AWSIM](https://tier4.github.io/AWSIM/) the following pointcloud_based_occupancy_grid_map configuration is highly recommended:

```yaml
scan_origin_frame: "velodyne_top"

grid_map_type: "OccupancyGridMapProjectiveBlindSpot"
OccupancyGridMapProjectiveBlindSpot:
  projection_dz_threshold: 0.01  [m] for avoiding null division
  obstacle_separation_threshold: 1.0  [m] fill the interval between obstacles with unknown for this length
```

You should set the top lidar link as the `scan_origin_frame`. In the example it is `velodyne_top`. The method `OccupancyGridMapProjectiveBlindSpot` estimates the FOV by running projective ray-tracing from `scan_origin` to obstacle or up to the ground and filling the cells on the "shadow" of the object as UNKNOWN.
