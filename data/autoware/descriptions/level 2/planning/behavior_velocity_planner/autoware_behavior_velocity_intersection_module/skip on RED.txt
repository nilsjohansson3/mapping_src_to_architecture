If the traffic light color is RED or Arrow signal is turned on, the attention lanes which are not conflicting with ego lane are not used for detection. And even if the object stops with a certain overshoot from its stopline, but its expected stop position under the deceleration of `collision_detection.ignore_on_amber_traffic_light.object_expected_deceleration` is more than the distance `collision_detection.ignore_on_red_traffic_light.object_margin_to_path` from collision point, the object is ignored.
