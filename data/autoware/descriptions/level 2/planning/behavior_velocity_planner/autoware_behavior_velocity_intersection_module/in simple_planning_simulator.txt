intersection_occlusion feature is **not recommended** for use in planning_simulator because the laserscan_based_occupancy_grid_map generates unnatural UNKNOWN cells in 2D manner:

- all the cells behind pedestrians are UNKNOWN
- no ground point clouds are generated

Also many users do not set traffic light information frequently although it is very critical for intersection_occlusion (and in real traffic environment too).

For these reasons, `occlusion.enable` is false by default.
