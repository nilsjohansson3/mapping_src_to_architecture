The following features are supported for trajectory validation and can have thresholds set by parameters:

- **Invalid field** : e.g. Inf, Nan
- **Trajectory points interval** : invalid if any of the distance of trajectory points is too large
- **Curvature** : invalid if the trajectory has too sharp turns that is not feasible for the given vehicle kinematics
- **Relative angle** : invalid if the yaw angle changes too fast in the sequence of trajectory points
- **Lateral acceleration** : invalid if the expected lateral acceleration/deceleration is too large
- **Longitudinal acceleration/deceleration** : invalid if the acceleration/deceleration in the trajectory point is too large
- **Steering angle** : invalid if the expected steering value is too large estimated from trajectory curvature
- **Steering angle rate** : invalid if the expected steering rate value is too large
- **Velocity deviation** : invalid if the planning velocity is too far from the ego velocity
- **Distance deviation** : invalid if the ego is too far from the trajectory
- **Longitudinal distance deviation** : invalid if the trajectory is too far from ego in longitudinal direction
- **Forward trajectory length** : invalid if the trajectory length is not enough to stop within a given deceleration

The following features are to be implemented.

- **(TODO) TTC calculation** : invalid if the expected time-to-collision is too short on the trajectory
