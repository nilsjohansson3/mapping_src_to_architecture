In Autoware's overarching design, the separation of components like Planning, Perception, Localization, and Control facilitates cooperation with third-party modules. However, this separation entails trade-offs between performance and extensibility. For instance, the Perception component might process unnecessary objects due to its separation from Planning. Similarly, separating planning and control can pose challenges in accounting for vehicle dynamics during planning. To mitigate these issues, we might need to enhance interface information or increase computational efforts.
