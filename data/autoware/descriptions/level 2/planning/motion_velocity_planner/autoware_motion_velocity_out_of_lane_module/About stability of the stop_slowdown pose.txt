As the input trajectory can change significantly between iterations,
it is expected that the decisions of this module will also change.
To make the decision more stable, a stop or slowdown pose is used for a minimum duration set by the `action.min_duration` parameter.
If during that time a new pose closer to the ego vehicle is generated, then it replaces the previous one.
Otherwise, the stop or slowdown pose will only be discarded after no out of lane collision is detection for the set duration.
