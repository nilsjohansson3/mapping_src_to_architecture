For each out of lane area, we calculate the times when a dynamic object will overlap the area based on its filtered predicted paths.

In the case where parameter `mode` is set to `threshold` and the calculated time is less than `threshold.time_threshold` parameter, then we decide to avoid the out of lane area.

In the case where parameter `mode` is set to `ttc`,
we calculate the time to collision by comparing the predicted time of the object with the `time_from_start` field contained in the trajectory point.
If the time to collision is bellow the `ttc.threshold` parameter value, we decide to avoid the out of lane area.

In the debug visualization, the ttc (in seconds) is displayed on top of its corresponding trajectory point.
The color of the text is red if the collision should be avoided and green otherwise.
