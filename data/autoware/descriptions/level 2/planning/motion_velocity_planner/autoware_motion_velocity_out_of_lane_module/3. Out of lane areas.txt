Next, for each trajectory point, we create the corresponding out of lane areas by subtracting the ego lanelets (from step 2) from the trajectory point footprint (from step 1).
Each area is associated with the lanelets overlapped by the area and with the corresponding ego trajectory point.

In the debug visualization, the out of lane area polygon is connected to the corresponding trajectory point by a line.
