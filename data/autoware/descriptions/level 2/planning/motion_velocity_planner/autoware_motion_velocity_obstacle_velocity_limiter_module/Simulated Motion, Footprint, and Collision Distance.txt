The motion of the ego vehicle is simulated at each trajectory point using the `heading`, `velocity`, and `steering` defined at the point.
Footprints are then constructed from these simulations and checked for collision.
If a collision is found, the distance from the trajectory point is used to calculate the adjusted velocity that would produce a collision-free footprint. Parameter `simulation.distance_method` allow to switch between an exact distance calculation and a less expensive approximation using a simple euclidean distance.

Two models can be selected with parameter `simulation.model` for simulating the motion of the vehicle: a simple particle model and a more complicated bicycle model.
