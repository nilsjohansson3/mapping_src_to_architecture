Obstacles are represented as points or linestrings (i.e., sequence of points) around the obstacles and are constructed from an occupancy grid, a pointcloud, or the lanelet map.
The lanelet map is always checked for obstacles but the other source is switched using parameter `obstacles.dynamic_source`.

To efficiently find obstacles intersecting with a footprint, they are stored in a [R-tree](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_80_0/libs/geometry/doc/html/geometry/reference/spatial_indexes/boost__geometry__index__rtree.html).
Two trees are used, one for the obstacle points, and one for the obstacle linestrings (which are decomposed into segments to simplify the R-tree).
