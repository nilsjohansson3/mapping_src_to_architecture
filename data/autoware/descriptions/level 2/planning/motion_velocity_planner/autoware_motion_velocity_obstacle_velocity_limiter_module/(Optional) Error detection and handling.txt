The critical case for this node is when an obstacle is falsely detected very close to the trajectory such that
the corresponding velocity suddenly becomes very low.
This can cause a sudden brake and two mechanisms can be used to mitigate these errors.

Parameter `min_adjusted_velocity` allow to set a minimum to the adjusted velocity, preventing the node to slow down the vehicle too much.
Parameter `max_deceleration` allow to set a maximum deceleration (relative to the _current_ ego velocity) that the adjusted velocity would incur.
