The bicycle model uses the constant heading, velocity, and steering of the vehicle at a trajectory point to simulate the future motion.
The simulated forward motion corresponds to an arc around the circle of curvature associated with the steering.
Uncertainty in the steering can be introduced with the `simulation.steering_offset` parameter which will generate a range of motion from a left-most to a right-most steering.
This results in 3 curved lines starting from the same trajectory point.
A parameter `simulation.nb_points` is used to adjust the precision of these lines, with a minimum of `2` resulting in straight lines and higher values increasing the precision of the curves.

By default, the steering values contained in the trajectory message are used.
Parameter `trajectory_preprocessing.calculate_steering_angles` allows to recalculate these values when set to `true`.
