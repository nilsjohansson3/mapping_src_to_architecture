The node only modifies part of the input trajectory, starting from the current ego position.
Parameter `trajectory_preprocessing.start_distance` is used to adjust how far ahead of the ego position the velocities will start being modified.
Parameters `trajectory_preprocessing.max_length` and `trajectory_preprocessing.max_duration` are used to control how much of the trajectory will see its velocity adjusted.

To reduce computation cost at the cost of precision, the trajectory can be downsampled using parameter `trajectory_preprocessing.downsample_factor`.
For example a value of `1` means all trajectory points will be evaluated while a value of `10` means only 1/10th of the points will be evaluated.
