Obstacles that are not inside any forward simulated footprint are ignored if parameter `obstacles.filter_envelope` is set to true.
The safety envelope polygon is built from all the footprints and used as a positive mask on the occupancy grid or pointcloud.

This option can reduce the total number of obstacles which reduces the cost of collision detection.
However, the cost of masking the envelope is usually too high to be interesting.
