Moving obstacles such as other cars should not be considered by this module.
These obstacles are detected by the perception modules and represented as polygons.
Obstacles inside these polygons are ignored.

Only dynamic obstacles with a velocity above parameter `obstacles.dynamic_obstacles_min_vel` are removed.

To deal with delays and precision errors, the polygons can be enlarged with parameter `obstacles.dynamic_obstacles_buffer`.
