If a collision is found, the velocity at the trajectory point is adjusted such that the resulting footprint would no longer collide with an obstacle:
$velocity = \frac{dist\_to\_collision}{min\_ttc}$

To prevent sudden deceleration of the ego vehicle, the parameter `max_deceleration` limits the deceleration relative to the current ego velocity.
For a trajectory point occurring at a duration `t` in the future (calculated from the original velocity profile),
the adjusted velocity cannot be set lower than $v_{current} - t * max\_deceleration$.

Furthermore, a parameter `min_adjusted_velocity`
provides a lower bound on the modified velocity.
