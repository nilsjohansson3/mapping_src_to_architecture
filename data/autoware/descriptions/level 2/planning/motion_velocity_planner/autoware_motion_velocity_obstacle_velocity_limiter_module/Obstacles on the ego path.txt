If parameter `obstacles.ignore_obstacles_on_path` is set to `true`, a polygon mask is built from the trajectory and the vehicle dimension. Any obstacle in this polygon is ignored.

The size of the polygon can be increased using parameter `obstacles.ignore_extra_distance` which is added to the vehicle lateral offset.

This option is a bit expensive and should only be used in case of noisy dynamic obstacles where obstacles are wrongly detected on the ego path, causing unwanted velocity limits.
