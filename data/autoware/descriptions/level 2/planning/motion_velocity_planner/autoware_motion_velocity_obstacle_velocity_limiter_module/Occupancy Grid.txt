Masking is performed by iterating through the cells inside each polygon mask using the [`autoware::grid_map_utils::PolygonIterator`](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.universe/tree/main/common/autoware_grid_map_utils) function.
A threshold is then applied to only keep cells with an occupancy value above parameter `obstacles.occupancy_grid_threshold`.
Finally, the image is converted to an image and obstacle linestrings are extracted using the opencv function
[`findContour`](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d3/dc0/group__imgproc__shape.htmlga17ed9f5d79ae97bd4c7cf18403e1689a).
