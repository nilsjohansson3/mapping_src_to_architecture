![Earliest collision example](docs/DynamicObstacleStop-Collision.drawio.svg)

We build the ego trajectory footprints as the set of ego footprint polygons projected on each trajectory point.
We then calculate the intersections between these ego trajectory footprints and the previously calculated immediate path rectangles.
An intersection is ignored if the object is not driving toward ego, i.e., the absolute angle between the object and the trajectory point is larger than $\frac{3 \pi}{4}$.

The collision point with the lowest arc length when projected on the ego trajectory will be used to calculate the final stop point.
