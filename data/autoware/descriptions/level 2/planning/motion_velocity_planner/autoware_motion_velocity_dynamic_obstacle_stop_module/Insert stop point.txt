![Stop point example](docs/DynamicObstacleStop-StopPoint.drawio.svg)

Before inserting a stop point, we calculate the range of trajectory arc lengths where it can be inserted.
The minimum is calculated to satisfy the acceleration and jerk constraints of the vehicle.
If a stop point was inserted in the previous iteration of the module, its arc length is used as the maximum.
Finally,
the stop point arc length is calculated to be the arc length of the previously found collision point minus the `stop_distance_buffer` and the ego vehicle longitudinal offset, clamped between the minimum and maximum values.
