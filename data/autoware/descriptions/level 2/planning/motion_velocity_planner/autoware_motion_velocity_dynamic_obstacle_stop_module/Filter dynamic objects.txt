![filtering example](docs/DynamicObstacleStop-Filtering.drawio.svg)

An object is considered by the module only if it meets all of the following conditions:

- it is a vehicle (pedestrians are ignored);
- it is moving at a velocity higher than defined by the `minimum_object_velocity` parameter;
- it is not too close to the current position of the ego vehicle;
- it is not unavoidable (only if parameter `ignore_unavoidable_collisions` is set to `true`);
- it is close to the ego trajectory.

An object is considered unavoidable if it is heading towards the ego vehicle such that even if ego stops, a collision would still occur (assuming the object keeps driving in a straight line).

For the last condition,
the object is considered close enough if its lateral distance from the ego trajectory is less than the threshold parameter `minimum_object_distance_from_ego_trajectory` plus half the width of ego and of the object (including the `extra_object_width` parameter).
In addition, the value of the `hysteresis` parameter is added to the minimum distance if a stop point was inserted in the previous iteration.
