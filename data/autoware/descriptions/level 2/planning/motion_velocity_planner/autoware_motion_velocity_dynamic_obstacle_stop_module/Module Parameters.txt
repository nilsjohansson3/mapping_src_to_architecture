| `minimum_object_velocity`                     | double | [m/s] objects with a velocity bellow this value are ignored                                                        |
| `stop_distance_buffer`                        | double | [m] extra distance to add between the stop point and the collision point                                           |
| `time_horizon`                                | double | [s] time horizon used for collision checks                                                                         |
| `hysteresis`                                  | double | [m] once a collision has been detected, this hysteresis is used on the collision detection                         |
| `add_stop_duration_buffer`                    | double | [s] duration where a collision must be continuously detected before a stop decision is added                       |
| `remove_stop_duration_buffer`                 | double | [s] duration between no collision being detected and the stop decision being remove                                |

| `ignore_unavoidable_collisions`               | bool   | [-] if true, ignore collisions that cannot be avoided by stopping (assuming the obstacle continues going straight) |
