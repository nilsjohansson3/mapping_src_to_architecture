![Immediate paths example](docs/DynamicObstacleStop-ImmediatePaths.drawio.svg)

For each considered object, a rectangle is created representing its _immediate_ path.
The rectangle has the width of the object plus the `extra_object_width` parameter
and its length is the current speed of the object multiplied by the `time_horizon`.
