To prevent chatter caused by noisy perception, two duration parameters are used.

- `add_stop_duration_buffer` represents the duration of consecutive collision detection with an object for the corresponding stop point to be added.
- `remove_stop_duration_buffer` represents the duration of consecutive non-detection of collision with an object for the corresponding stop point to be removed.

Timers and collision points are tracked for each dynamic object independently.
