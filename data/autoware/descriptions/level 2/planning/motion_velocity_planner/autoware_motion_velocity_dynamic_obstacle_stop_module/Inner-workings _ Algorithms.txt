The module insert a stop point where the ego trajectory collides with the immediate path of an object.
The overall module flow can be summarized with the following 4 steps.

1. Filter dynamic objects.
2. Calculate immediate path rectangles of the dynamic objects.
3. Find earliest collision where ego collides with an immediate path rectangle.
4. Insert stop point before the collision.

In addition to these 4 steps, 2 mechanisms are in place to make the stop point of this module more stable: an hysteresis and a decision duration buffer.

The `hysteresis` parameter is used when a stop point was already being inserted in the previous iteration
and it increases the range where dynamic objects are considered close enough to the ego trajectory to be used by the module.
