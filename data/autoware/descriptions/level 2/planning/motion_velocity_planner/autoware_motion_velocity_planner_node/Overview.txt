`motion_velocity_planner` is a planner to adjust the trajectory velocity based on the obstacles around the vehicle.
It loads modules as plugins. Please refer to the links listed below for detail on each module.

Each module calculates stop and slow down points to be inserted in the ego trajectory.
These points are assumed to correspond to the `base_link` frame of the ego vehicle as it follows the trajectory.
This means that to stop before a wall, a stop point is inserted in the trajectory at a distance ahead of the wall equal to the vehicle front offset (wheelbase + front overhang, see the [vehicle dimensions](https://autowarefoundation.github.io/autoware-documentation/main/design/autoware-interfaces/components/vehicle-dimensions/).
