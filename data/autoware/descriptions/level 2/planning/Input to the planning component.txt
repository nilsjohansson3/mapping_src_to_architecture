- **From Map**
  - Vector map: Contains all static information about the environment, including lane connection information for route planning, lane geometry for generating a reference path, and traffic rule-related information.
- **From Perception**
  - Detected object information: Provides real-time information about objects that cannot be known in advance, such as pedestrians and other vehicles. The Planning Component plans maneuvers to avoid collisions with these objects.
  - Detected obstacle information: Supplies real-time information about the location of obstacles, which is more primitive than Detected Object and used for emergency stops and other safety measures.
  - Occupancy map information: Offers real-time information about the presence of pedestrians and other vehicles and occluded area information.
  - Traffic light recognition result: Provides the current state of each traffic light in real time. The Planning Component extracts relevant information for the planned path and determines whether to stop at intersections.
- **From Localization**
  - Vehicle motion information: Includes the ego vehicle's position, velocity, acceleration, and other motion-related data.
- **From System**
  - Operation mode: Indicates whether the vehicle is operating in Autonomous mode.
- **From Human Machine Interface (HMI)**
  - Feature execution: Allows for executing/authorizing autonomous driving operations, such as lane changes or entering intersections, by human operators.
- **From API Layer**
  - Destination (Goal): Represents the final position that the Planning Component aims to reach.
  - Checkpoint: Represents a midpoint along the route to the destination. This is used during route calculation.
  - Velocity limit: Sets the maximum speed limit for the vehicle.
