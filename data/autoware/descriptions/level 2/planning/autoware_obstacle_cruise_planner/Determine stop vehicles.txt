Among obstacles which are not for cruising, the obstacles meeting the following condition are determined as obstacles for stopping.

- The object type is for stopping according to `common.stop_obstacle_type.*`.
- The lateral distance from the object to the ego's trajectory is smaller than `behavior_determination.stop.max_lat_margin`.
- The object velocity along the ego's trajectory is smaller than `behavior_determination.obstacle_velocity_threshold_from_stop_to_cruise`.
- The object
  - does not cross the ego's trajectory (\*1)
  - with the velocity smaller than `behavior_determination.crossing_obstacle.obstacle_velocity_threshold`
  - and its collision time margin is large enough (\*2).
