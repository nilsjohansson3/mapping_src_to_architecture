- Common
  - When the obstacle pose or velocity estimation has a delay, the ego sometimes will go close to the front vehicle keeping deceleration.
  - Current implementation only uses predicted objects message for static/dynamic obstacles and does not use pointcloud. Therefore, if object recognition is lost, the ego cannot deal with the lost obstacle.
  - The current predicted paths for obstacle's lane change does not have enough precision for obstacle_cruise_planner. Therefore, we set `rough_detection_area` a small value.
- PID-based planner
  - The algorithm strongly depends on the velocity smoothing package (`motion_velocity_smoother` by default) whether or not the ego realizes the designated target speed. If the velocity smoothing package is updated, please take care of the vehicle's behavior as much as possible.
