When stopping for a pedestrian walking on the crosswalk, the behavior module inserts the zero velocity in the trajectory in front of the crosswalk.
Also `autoware_obstacle_cruise_planner`'s stop planning also works, and the ego may not reach the behavior module's stop point since the safe distance defined in `autoware_obstacle_cruise_planner` may be longer than the behavior module's safe distance.
To resolve this non-alignment of the stop point between the behavior module and `autoware_obstacle_cruise_planner`, `common.min_behavior_stop_margin` is defined.
In the case of the crosswalk described above, `autoware_obstacle_cruise_planner` inserts the stop point with a distance `common.min_behavior_stop_margin` at minimum between the ego and obstacle.
