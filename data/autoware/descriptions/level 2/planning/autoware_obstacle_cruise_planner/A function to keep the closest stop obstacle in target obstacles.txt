In order to keep the closest stop obstacle in the target obstacles, we check whether it is disappeared or not from the target obstacles in the `checkConsistency` function.
If the previous closest stop obstacle is remove from the lists, we keep it in the lists for `stop_obstacle_hold_time_threshold` seconds.
Note that if a new stop obstacle appears and the previous closest obstacle removes from the lists, we do not add it to the target obstacles again.
