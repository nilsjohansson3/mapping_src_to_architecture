We predict the collision area and its time by the ego with a constant velocity motion and the obstacle with its predicted path.
Then, we calculate a collision time margin which is the difference of the time when the ego will be inside the collision area and the obstacle will be inside the collision area.
When this time margin is smaller than `behavior_determination.stop.crossing_obstacle.collision_time_margin`, the margin is not enough.
