The obstacles meeting the following condition are determined as obstacles for cruising.

- The lateral distance from the object to the ego's trajectory is smaller than `behavior_determination.cruise.max_lat_margin`.

- The object type is for cruising according to `common.cruise_obstacle_type.*`.
- The object is not crossing the ego's trajectory (\*1).
- If the object is inside the trajectory.
  - The object type is for inside cruising according to `common.cruise_obstacle_type.inside.*`.
  - The object velocity is larger than `behavior_determination.obstacle_velocity_threshold_from_cruise_to_stop`.
- If the object is outside the trajectory.
  - The object type is for outside cruising according to `common.cruise_obstacle_type.outside.*`.
  - The object velocity is larger than `behavior_determination.cruise.outside_obstacle.obstacle_velocity_threshold`.
  - The highest confident predicted path collides with the ego's trajectory.
  - Its collision's period is larger than `behavior_determination.cruise.outside_obstacle.ego_obstacle_overlap_time_threshold`.
