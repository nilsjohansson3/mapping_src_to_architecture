This diagram illustrates the high-level architecture of the Planning Component. This represents an idealized design, and current implementations might vary. Further details on implementations are provided in the latter sections of this document.

Following the principles of microautonomy architecture, we have adopted a modular system framework. The functions within the Planning domain are implemented as modules, dynamically or statically adaptable according to specific use cases. This includes modules for lane changes, intersection handling, and pedestrian crossings, among others.

The Planning Component comprises several sub-components:

- **Mission Planning**: This module calculates routes from the current location to the destination, utilizing map data. Its functionality is similar to that of Fleet Management Systems (FMS) or car navigation route planning.
- **Planning Modules**: These modules plans the vehicle's behavior for the assigned mission, including target trajectory, blinker signaling, etc. They are divided into Behavior and Motion categories:
  - **Behavior**: Focuses on calculating safe and rule-compliant routes, managing decisions for lane changes, intersection entries, and stoppings at a stop line.
  - **Motion**: Works in cooperate with Behavior modules to determine the vehicle's trajectory, considering its motion and ride comfort. It includes lateral and longitudinal planning for route shaping and speed calculation.
- **Validation**: Ensures the safety and appropriateness of the planned trajectories, with capabilities for emergency response. In cases where a planned trajectory is unsuitable, it triggers emergency protocols or generates alternative paths.
