There are multiple parameters available for configuration, and users have the option to modify them in [here](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware_launch/tree/main/autoware_launch/config/planning). It's important to note that not all parameters are adjustable via `rqt_reconfigure`. To ensure the changes are effective, modify the parameters and then restart Autoware. Additionally, detailed information about each parameter is available in the corresponding documents under the planning tab.
