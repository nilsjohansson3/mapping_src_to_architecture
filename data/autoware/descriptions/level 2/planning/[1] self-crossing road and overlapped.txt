To support the self-crossing road and overlapped road in the opposite direction, each planning module has to meet the [specifications](https://autowarefoundation.github.io/autoware.universe/main/common/motion_utils/)

Currently, the supported modules are as follows.

- lane_following (in behavior_path_planner)
- detection_area (in behavior_velocity_planner)
- stop_line (in behavior_velocity_planner)
- virtual_traffic_light (in behavior_velocity_planner)
- obstacle_avoidance_planner
- obstacle_stop_planner
- motion_velocity_smoother
