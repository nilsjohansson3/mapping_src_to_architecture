Sometimes the optimized centerline footprints are close to the lanes' boundaries.
We can check how close they are with `unsafe footprints` marker as follows.

Footprints' color depends on its distance to the boundaries, and text expresses its distance.

By default, footprints' color is

- when the distance is less than 0.1 [m] : red
- when the distance is less than 0.2 [m] : green
- when the distance is less than 0.3 [m] : blue
