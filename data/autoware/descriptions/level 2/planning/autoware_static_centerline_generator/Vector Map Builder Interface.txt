Note: This function of Vector Map Builder has not been released. Please wait for a while.
Currently there is no documentation about Vector Map Builder's operation for this function.

The optimized centerline can be generated from Vector Map Builder's operation.

We can run

- path planning server
- http server to connect path planning server and Vector Map Builder

with the following command by designating `<vehicle_model>`

```sh
ros2 launch autoware_static_centerline_generator run_planning_server.launch.xml vehicle_model:=<vehicle-model>
```

FYI, port ID of the http server is 4010 by default.
