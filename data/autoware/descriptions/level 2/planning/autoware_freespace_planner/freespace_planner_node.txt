`freespace_planner_node` is a global path planner node that plans trajectory
in the space having static/dynamic obstacles. This node is currently based on
Hybrid A\* search algorithm in `freespace_planning_algorithms` package.
Other algorithms such as rrt\* will be also added and selectable in the future.

**Note**
Due to the constraint of trajectory following, the output trajectory will be split to include only the single direction path.
In other words, the output trajectory doesn't include both forward and backward trajectories at once.
