- All planning algorithm class in this package must inherit `AbstractPlanningAlgorithm`
  class. If necessary, please overwrite the virtual functions.
- All algorithms must use `nav_msgs::OccupancyGrid`-typed costmap.
  Thus, `AbstractPlanningAlgorithm` class mainly implements the collision checking
  using the costmap, grid-based indexing, and coordinate transformation related to
  costmap.
- All algorithms must take both `PlannerCommonParam`-typed and algorithm-specific-
  type structs as inputs of the constructor. For example, `AstarSearch` class's
  constructor takes both `PlannerCommonParam` and `AstarParam`.
