There is an implementation of the extension to the python module.
You can try A\* search via Python by setting follows:

- parameters,
- costmap,
- start pose,
- goal pose.

Then, you can get

- success or failure,
- searched trajectory.

The example code is [scripts/example/example.py](scripts/example/example.py).
Note that you need to build this package and source the setup shell script in advance.
