Building the package with ros-test and run tests:

```sh
colcon build --packages-select autoware_freespace_planning_algorithms
colcon test --packages-select autoware_freespace_planning_algorithms
```

<!-- cspell: ignore fpalgos -->
<!-- "fpalgos" means Free space Planning ALGOrithmS -->

Inside the test, simulation results are stored in `/tmp/fpalgos-{algorithm_type}-case{scenario_number}` as a rosbag.
Loading these resulting files, by using [test/debug_plot.py](test/debug_plot.py),
one can create plots visualizing the path and obstacles as shown
in the figures below. The created figures are then again saved in `/tmp`.
