The Planner Manager's responsibilities include:

1. Activating the relevant scene module in response to the specific situation faced by the autonomous vehicle. For example, when a parked vehicle blocks the ego vehicle's driving lane, the manager would engage the avoidance module.
2. Managing the execution order when multiple modules are running simultaneously. For instance, if both the lane-changing and avoidance modules are operational, the manager decides which should take precedence.
3. Merging paths from multiple modules when they are activated simultaneously and each generates its own path, thereby creating a single functional path.

!!! note

    To check the scene module's transition, i.e.: registered, approved and candidate modules, set `verbose: true` in the [behavior path planner configuration file](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware_launch/blob/0cd5d891a36ac34a32a417205905c109f2bafe7b/autoware_launch/config/planning/scenario_planning/lane_driving/behavior_planning/behavior_path_planner/behavior_path_planner.param.yamlL3).
