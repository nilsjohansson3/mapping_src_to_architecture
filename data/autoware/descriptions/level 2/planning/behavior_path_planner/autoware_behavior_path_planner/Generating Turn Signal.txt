The Behavior Path Planner module uses the `autoware_vehicle_msgs::msg::TurnIndicatorsCommand` to output turn signal commands (see [TurnIndicatorsCommand.idl](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware_msgs/blob/main/autoware_vehicle_msgs/msg/TurnIndicatorsCommand.msg)). The system evaluates the driving context and determines when to activate turn signals based on its maneuver planningâ€”like turning, lane changing, or obstacle avoidance.

Within this framework, the system differentiates between **desired** and **required** blinker activations. **Desired** activations are those recommended by traffic laws for typical driving scenarios, such as signaling before a lane change or turn. **Required** activations are those that are deemed mandatory for safety reasons, like signaling an abrupt lane change to avoid an obstacle.

The `TurnIndicatorsCommand` message structure has a command field that can take one of several constants: `NO_COMMAND` indicates no signal is necessary, `DISABLE` to deactivate signals, `ENABLE_LEFT` to signal a left turn, and `ENABLE_RIGHT` to signal a right turn. The Behavior Path Planner sends these commands at the appropriate times, based on its rules-based system that considers both the **desired** and **required** scenarios for blinker activation.
