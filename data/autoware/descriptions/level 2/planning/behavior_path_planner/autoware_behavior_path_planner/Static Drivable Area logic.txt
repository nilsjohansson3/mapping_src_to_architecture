The drivable area is used to determine the area in which the ego vehicle can travel. The primary goal of static drivable area expansion is to ensure safe travel by generating an area that encompasses only the necessary spaces for the vehicle's current behavior, while excluding non-essential areas. For example, while `avoidance` module is running, the drivable area includes additional space needed for maneuvers around obstacles, and it limits the behavior by not extending the avoidance path outside of lanelet areas.

Static drivable area expansion operates under assumptions about the correct arrangement of lanes and the coverage of both the front and rear of the vehicle within the left and right boundaries. Key parameters for drivable area generation include extra footprint offsets for the ego vehicle, the handling of dynamic objects, maximum expansion distance, and specific methods for expansion. Additionally, since each module generates its own drivable area, before passing it as the input to generate the next running module's drivable area, or before generating a unified drivable area, the system sorts drivable lanes based on the vehicle's passage order. This ensures the correct definition of the lanes used in drivable area generation.
