The Behavior Path Planner's main objective is to significantly enhance the safety of autonomous vehicles by minimizing the risk of accidents. It improves driving efficiency through time conservation and underpins reliability with its rule-based approach. Additionally, it allows users to integrate their own custom behavior modules or use it with different types of vehicles, such as cars, buses, and delivery robots, as well as in various environments, from busy urban streets to open highways.

The module begins by thoroughly analyzing the ego vehicle's current situation, including its position, speed, and surrounding environment. This analysis leads to essential driving decisions about lane changes or stopping and subsequently generates a path that is both safe and efficient. It considers road geometry, traffic rules, and dynamic conditions while also incorporating obstacle avoidance to respond to static and dynamic obstacles such as other vehicles, pedestrians, or unexpected roadblocks, ensuring safe navigation.

Moreover, the planner actively interacts with other traffic participants, predicting their actions and accordingly adjusting the vehicle's path. This ensures not only the safety of the autonomous vehicle but also contributes to smooth traffic flow. Its adherence to traffic laws, including speed limits and traffic signals, further guarantees lawful and predictable driving behavior. The planner is also designed to minimize sudden or abrupt maneuvers, aiming for a comfortable and natural driving experience.
