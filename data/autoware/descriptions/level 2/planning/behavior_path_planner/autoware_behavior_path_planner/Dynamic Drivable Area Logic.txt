Large vehicles require much more space, which sometimes causes them to veer out of their current lane. A typical example being a bus making a turn at a corner. In such cases, relying on a static drivable area is insufficient, since the static method depends on lane information provided by high-definition maps. To overcome the limitations of the static approach, the dynamic drivable area expansion algorithm adjusts the navigable space for an autonomous vehicle in real-time. It conserves computational power by reusing previously calculated path data, updating only when there is a significant change in the vehicle's position. The system evaluates the minimum lane width necessary to accommodate the vehicle's turning radius and other dynamic factors. It then calculates the optimal expansion of the drivable area's boundaries to ensure there is adequate space for safe maneuvering, taking into account the vehicle's path curvature. The rate at which these boundaries can expand or contract is moderated to maintain stability in the vehicle's navigation. The algorithm aims to maximize the drivable space while avoiding fixed obstacles and adhering to legal driving limits. Finally, it applies these boundary adjustments and smooths out the path curvature calculations to ensure a safe and legally compliant navigable path is maintained throughout the vehicle's operation.
