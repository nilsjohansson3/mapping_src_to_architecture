This is a very simple function that plans a smooth path to a specified goal. This function does not require approval and always runs with the other modules.
_NOTE: this planner does not perform the several features described below, such as "goal search", "collision check", "safety check", etc._

Executed when both conditions are met.

- Route is set with `allow_goal_modification=false`. This is the default.
- The goal is set in the normal lane. In other words, it is NOT `road_shoulder`.
- Ego-vehicle exists in the same lane sequence as the goal.

If the target path contains a goal, modify the points of the path so that the path and the goal are connected smoothly. This process will change the shape of the path by the distance of `refine_goal_search_radius_range` from the goal. Note that this logic depends on the interpolation algorithm that will be executed in a later module (at the moment it uses spline interpolation), so it needs to be updated in the future.
