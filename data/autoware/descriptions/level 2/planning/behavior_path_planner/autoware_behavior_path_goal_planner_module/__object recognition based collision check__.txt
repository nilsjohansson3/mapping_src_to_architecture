A collision decision is made for each of the path candidates, and a collision-free path is selected.
There are three main margins at this point.

- `object_recognition_collision_check_margin` is margin in all directions of ego.
- In the forward direction, a margin is added by the braking distance calculated from the current speed and maximum deceleration. The maximum distance is The maximum value of the distance is suppressed by the `object_recognition_collision_check_max_extra_stopping_margin`
- In curves, the lateral margin is larger than in straight lines.This is because curves are more prone to control errors or to fear when close to objects (The maximum value is limited by `object_recognition_collision_check_max_extra_stopping_margin`, although it has no basis.)

Then there is the concept of soft and hard margins. Although not currently parameterized, if a collision-free path can be generated by a margin several times larger than `object_recognition_collision_check_margin`, then the priority is higher.
