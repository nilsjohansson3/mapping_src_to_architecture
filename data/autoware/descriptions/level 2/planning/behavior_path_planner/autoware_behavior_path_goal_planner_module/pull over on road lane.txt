- The distance between the goal and ego-vehicle is shorter than `pull_over_minimum_request_length`.
- Route is set with `allow_goal_modification=true` .
  - We can set this option with [SetRoute](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware_adapi_msgs/blob/main/autoware_adapi_v1_msgs/routing/srv/SetRoute.srvL2) api service.
  - We support `2D Rough Goal Pose` with the key bind `r` in RViz, but in the future there will be a panel of tools to manipulate various Route API from RViz.
- The terminal point of the current path is in the same lane sequence as the goal. If goal is on the road shoulder, then it is in the adjacent road lane sequence.
