Perform safety checks on moving objects. If the object is determined to be dangerous, no path decision is made and no approval is given,

- path decision is not made and approval is not granted.
- After approval, the ego vehicle stops under deceleration and jerk constraints.

This module has two methods of safety check, `RSS` and `integral_predicted_polygon`.

`RSS` method is a method commonly used by other behavior path planner modules, see [RSS based safety check utils explanation](../autoware_behavior_path_planner_common/docs/behavior_path_planner_safety_check.md).

`integral_predicted_polygon` is a more safety-oriented method. This method is implemented because speeds during pull over are lower than during driving, and fewer objects travel along the edge of the lane. (It is sometimes too reactive and may be less available.)
This method integrates the footprints of egos and objects at a given time and checks for collisions between them.

In addition, the safety check has a time hysteresis, and if the path is judged "safe" for a certain period of time(`keep_unsafe_time`), it is finally treated as "safe".
