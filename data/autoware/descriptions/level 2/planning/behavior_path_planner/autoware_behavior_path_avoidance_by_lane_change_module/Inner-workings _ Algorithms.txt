Basically, this module is implemented by reusing the avoidance target filtering logic of the existing [Static Object Avoidance Module](../autoware_behavior_path_static_obstacle_avoidance_module/README.md) and the path generation logic of the [Normal Lane Change Module](../autoware_behavior_path_lane_change_module/README.md). On the other hand, the conditions under which the module is activated differ from those of a normal avoidance module.

Check that the following conditions are satisfied after the filtering process for the avoidance target.
