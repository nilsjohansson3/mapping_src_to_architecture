Unlike the normal avoidance module, which specifies the shift line end point, this module does not specify its end point when generating a lane change path. On the other hand, setting `execute_only_when_lane_change_finish_before_object` to `true` will activate this module only if the lane change can be completed before the avoidance target object.

Although setting the parameter to `false` would increase the scene of avoidance by lane change, it is assumed that sufficient lateral margin may not be ensured in some cases because the vehicle passes by the side of obstacles during the lane change.
