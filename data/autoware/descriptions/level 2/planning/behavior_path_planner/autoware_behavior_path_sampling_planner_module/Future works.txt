Some possible improvements for this module include:

-Implementing a dynamic weight tuning algorithm: Dynamically change weights depending on the scenario (ie. to prioritize more the paths with low curvature and low avg. lat. deviation after all obstacles have been avoided).

-Implementing multi-objective optimization to improve computing time and possibly make a more dynamic soft constraints weight tuning. [Related publication](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10180226).

-Implement bezier curves as another method to obtain samples, see the [sampling_based_planner module](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.universe/tree/main/planning/sampling_based_planner).

-Explore the possibility to replace several or other behavior path modules with the sampling based behavior path module.

-Perform real-life tests of this module once it has matured and some of its limitations have been solved.
