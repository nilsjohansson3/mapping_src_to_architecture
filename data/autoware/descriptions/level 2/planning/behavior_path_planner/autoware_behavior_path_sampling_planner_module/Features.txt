This package is able to:

- create a smooth trajectory to avoid static obstacles.
- guarantees the generated trajectory (if any) complies with customizable hard constraints.
- transitions to a success state after the ego vehicle merges to its goal lane.
- re-use previously generated outputs to re-sample new alternative paths

Note that the velocity is just taken over from the input path.
