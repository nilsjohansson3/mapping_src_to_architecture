Among the valid candidate trajectories, the _best_ one is determined using a set of soft constraints (i.e., objective functions).

- curvature: prefer smoother trajectories;
- length: prefer trajectories with longer remaining path length;
- lateral deviation: prefer trajectories close to the goal.

Each soft constraint is associated with a weight to allow tuning of the preferences.
