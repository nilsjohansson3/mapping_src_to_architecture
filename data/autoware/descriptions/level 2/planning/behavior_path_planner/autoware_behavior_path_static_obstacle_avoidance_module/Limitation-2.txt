The yield maneuver is executed **ONLY** when the vehicle has **NOT** initiated avoidance maneuver yet. (This module checks objects in the opposite lane but it is necessary to find very far objects to judge whether it is unsafe before avoidance maneuver.) If it detects a vehicle which is approaching the ego during an avoidance maneuver, this module doesn't revert the path or insert a stop point. For now, there is no feature to deal with this situation in this module. Thus, a new module is needed to adjust the path to avoid moving objects, or an operator must override.

!!! info

    This module has a threshold parameter `th_avoid_execution` for the shift length, and judges that the vehicle is initiating avoidance if the vehicle current shift exceeds the value.
