This module inserts a stop point only when the ego can potentially avoid the object. So, if it is not able to keep a distance more than `hard_margin`/`hard_margin_for_parked_vehicle`, this module does nothing. The following figure shows the situation where this module is not able to keep enough lateral distance when the user sets parameter `use_lane_type` to `same_direction_lane`.

!!! info

    In this situation, the obstacle stop feature in [obstacle_cruise_planner](../../autoware_obstacle_cruise_planner/README.md) is responsible for ego vehicle safety.
