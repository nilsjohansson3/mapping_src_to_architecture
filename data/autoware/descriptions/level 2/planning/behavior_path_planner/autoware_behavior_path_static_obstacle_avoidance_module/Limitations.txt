This module allows developers to design vehicle behavior in avoidance planning using specific rules. Due to the property of rule-based planning, the algorithm cannot compensate for not colliding with obstacles in complex cases. This is a trade-off between "be intuitive and easy to design" and "be hard to tune but can handle many cases". This module adopts the former policy and therefore this output should be checked more strictly in the later stage. In the .iv reference implementation, there is another avoidance module in the motion planning module that uses optimization to handle the avoidance in complex cases. (Note that, the motion planner needs to be adjusted so that the behavior result will not be changed much in the simple case and this is a typical challenge for the behavior-motion hierarchical architecture.)
