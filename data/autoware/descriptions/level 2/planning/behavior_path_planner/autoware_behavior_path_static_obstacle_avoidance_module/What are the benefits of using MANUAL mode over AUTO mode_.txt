MANUAL mode allows the operator to have direct control over the approval of avoidance paths, which is particularly useful in situations where sensor data may be unreliable or ambiguous.
This mode helps prevent unnecessary or incorrect avoidance maneuvers by requiring human validation before execution.
It is recommended for environments where false positives are likely or when the sensor/perception system's performance is limited.
