If the module cannot find a safe avoidance path, the vehicle may stop or continue along its current path without performing an avoidance maneuver.
If there is a target object and there is enough space to avoid, the ego vehicle would stop at a position where an avoidance path could be generated; this is called the [yield manuever](yield-maneuver).
On the other hand, where there is not enough space, this module has nothing to do and the [obstacle cruise planner](../../autoware_obstacle_cruise_planner/README.md) would be in charge of the object.
