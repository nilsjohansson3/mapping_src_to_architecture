In order to prevent chattering of recognition results, once an obstacle is targeted, it is held for a while even if it disappears. This is effective when recognition is unstable. However, since it will result in over-detection (increases number of false-positives), it is necessary to adjust parameters according to the recognition accuracy (if `object_last_seen_threshold = 0.0`, the recognition result is 100% trusted).
