Not only the length from the centerline, but also the length from the road shoulder is calculated and used for the filtering process. In this logic, it calculates ratio of **actual shift length** to **shiftable shift length** as follows. If the result is larger than threshold `th_shiftable_ratio`, the module judges the vehicle is a parked vehicle.

$$
L_{d} = \frac{W_{lane} - W_{obj}}{2}, \\
ratio =  \frac{L_{a}}{L_{d}}
$$

- $L_{d}$ : shiftable length.
- $L_{a}$ : actual shift length.
- $W_{lane}$ : lane width.
- $W_{obj}$ : object width.
