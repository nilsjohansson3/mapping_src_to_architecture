The lateral shift length is the sum of `overhang_distance`, lateral margin, whose value is set in the config file, and half of ego vehicle width defined in `vehicle_info.param.yaml`. On the other hand, the module limits the shift length depending on the space the module can use for an avoidance maneuver and the parameters `soft_drivable_bound_margin` `hard_drivable_bound_margin`. Basically, the shift length is limited so that the ego doesn't get closer than `soft_drivable_bound_margin` to the drivable boundary. But the module allows the threshold to be relaxed from `soft_drivable_bound_margin` to `hard_drivable_bound_margin` when the road is narrow.

Usable lanes for the avoidance module can be selected using the config file.
