(see [here](width-of-detection-area))                                    | Never avoid it.                 |

(see [here](for-crosswalk-users)) | Never avoid it.                 |
| Is the distance between the object and traffic light along the path longer than the threshold? | Car, Truck, Bus, Trailer | The module uses this condition when there is ambiguity about whether the vehicle is parked.                                                                                          | It depends on other conditions. |

(see [here](judge-if-its-a-parked-vehicle))                                                  | It depends on other conditions. |
| Is merging into ego lane from other lane?                                                      | Car, Truck, Bus, Trailer | The module judges the vehicle behavior based on its yaw angle and offset direction. (see [here](judge-vehicle-behavior))                                                            | It depends on other conditions. |
