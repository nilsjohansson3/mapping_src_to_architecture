This feature can be enabled by setting the following parameter to `true`.

```yaml
      safety_check:
        ...
        enable: true                                     [-]
```

This module pays attention not only to avoidance target objects but also non-target objects that are near the avoidance path, and if the avoidance path is unsafe due to surrounding objects, it reverts the avoidance maneuver and yields the lane to them.
