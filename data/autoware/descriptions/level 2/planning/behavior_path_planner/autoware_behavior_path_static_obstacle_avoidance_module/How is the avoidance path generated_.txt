The avoidance path is generated by modifying the current reference path to navigate around detected static objects.
This is done using a rule-based shift line approach that ensures the vehicle remains within safe boundaries and follows the road while avoiding obstacles.
Details are explained in the [appendix](appendix-shift-line-generation-pipeline).
