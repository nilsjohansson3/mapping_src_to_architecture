This is a rule-based avoidance module, which runs based on perception output data, HDMap, current path and route. This module is designed to create avoidance paths for static (=stopped) objects in simple situations. Currently, this module doesn't support dynamic (=moving) objects.

This module has an [RTC interface](../../autoware_rtc_interface/README.md), and the user can select operation mode from MANUAL/AUTO depending on the performance of the vehicle's sensors. If the user selects MANUAL mode, this module outputs a candidate avoidance path and awaits operator approval. In the case where the sensor/perception performance is insufficient and false positives occur, we recommend MANUAL mode to prevent unnecessary avoidance maneuvers.

If the user selects AUTO mode, this module modifies the current following path without operator approval. If the sensor/perception performance is sufficient, use AUTO mode.
