There are three main filtering functions `isSatisfiedWithCommonCondition()`, `isSatisfiedWithVehicleCondition()` and `isSatisfiedWithNonVehicleCondition()`. The filtering process is executed according to the following flowchart. Additionally, the module checks avoidance necessity in `isNoNeedAvoidanceBehavior()` based on the object pose, ego path and lateral margin in the config file.

```plantuml
@startuml
