Generate shift points for multiple obstacles. All of them are merged to generate new shift points along the reference path. The new points are filtered (e.g. remove small-impact shift points), and the avoidance path is computed for the filtered shift points.

**Merge process of raw shift points**: check the shift length on each path point. If the shift points are overlapped, the maximum shift value is selected for the same direction.

For the details of the shift point filtering, see [filtering for shift points](filtering-for-shift-points).
