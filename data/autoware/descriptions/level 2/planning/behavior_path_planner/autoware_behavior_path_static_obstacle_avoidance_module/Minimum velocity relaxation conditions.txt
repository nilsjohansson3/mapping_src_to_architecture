There is a problem that we cannot know the actual speed during avoidance in advance. This is especially critical when the ego vehicle speed is 0.
To solve that, this module provides a parameter for the minimum avoidance speed, which is used for the lateral jerk calculation when the vehicle speed is low.

- If the ego vehicle speed is lower than "nominal" minimum speed, use the minimum speed in the calculation of the jerk.
- If the ego vehicle speed is lower than "sharp" minimum speed and a nominal lateral jerk is not enough for avoidance (the case where the ego vehicle is stopped close to the obstacle), use the "sharp" minimum speed in the calculation of the jerk (it should be lower than "nominal" speed).
