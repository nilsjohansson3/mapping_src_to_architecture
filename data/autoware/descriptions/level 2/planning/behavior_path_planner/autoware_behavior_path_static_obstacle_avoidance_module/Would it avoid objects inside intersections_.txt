Basically, the module assumes that there are no parked vehicles within intersections. Vehicles that follow the lane or merge into ego lane are non-target objects.
Vehicles waiting to make a right/left turn within an intersection can be avoided by expanding the drivable area in the configuration file, as noted in the [drivable area expansion section](drivable-area-expansion).
