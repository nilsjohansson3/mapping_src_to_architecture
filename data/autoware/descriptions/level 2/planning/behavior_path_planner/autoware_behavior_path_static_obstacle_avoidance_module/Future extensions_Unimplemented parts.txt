- **Consideration of the speed of the avoidance target**

  - In the current implementation, only stopped vehicle is targeted as an avoidance target. It is needed to support the overtaking function for low-speed vehicles, such as a bicycle. (It is actually possible to overtake the low-speed objects by changing the parameter, but the logic is not supported and thus the safety cannot be guaranteed.)
  - Overtaking (e.g., to overtake a vehicle running in front at 20 km/h at 40 km/h) may need to be handled outside the avoidance module. It should be discussed which module should handle it.

- **Cancel avoidance when target disappears**

  - In the current implementation, even if the avoidance target disappears, the avoidance path will remain. If there is no longer a need to avoid, it must be canceled.

- **Improved performance of avoidance target selection**

  - Essentially, avoidance targets are judged based on whether they are static objects or not. For example, a vehicle waiting at a traffic light should not be avoided because we know that it will start moving in the future. However this decision cannot be made in the current Autoware due to the lack of perception functions. Therefore, the current avoidance module limits the avoidance target to vehicles parked on the shoulder of the road, and executes avoidance only for vehicles that are stopped away from the center of the lane. However, this logic cannot avoid a vehicle that has broken down and is stopped in the center of the lane, which should be recognized as a static object by the perception module. There is room for improvement in the performance of this decision.

- **Resampling path**
  - Now the rough resolution resampling is processed to the output path in order to reduce the computational cost for the later modules. This resolution is set to a uniformly large value (e.g. `5m`), but a small resolution should be applied for complex paths.
