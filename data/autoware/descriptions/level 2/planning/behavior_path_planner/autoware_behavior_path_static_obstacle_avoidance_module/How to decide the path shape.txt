Generate shift points for obstacles with a given lateral jerk. These points are integrated to generate an avoidance path. The detailed process flow for each case corresponding to the obstacle placement are described below. The actual implementation is not separated for each case, but the function corresponding to `multiple obstacle case (both directions)` is always running.
