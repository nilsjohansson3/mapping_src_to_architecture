The conditions for vehicle type objects and non-vehicle type objects are different. However, the main idea is that static objects on road shoulders within the planned path would be avoided.
Below are some examples when an avoidance path is generated for vehicle type objects.

- Vehicle stopping on ego lane while pulling over to the side of the road
- Vehicle stopping on adjacent lane
