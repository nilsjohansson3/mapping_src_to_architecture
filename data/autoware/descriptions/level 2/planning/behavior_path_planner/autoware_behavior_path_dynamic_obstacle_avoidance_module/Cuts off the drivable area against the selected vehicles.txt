For the selected obstacles to be avoided, the module cuts off the drivable area.
As inputs to decide the shapes of cut-off polygons, poses of the obstacles are mainly used, assuming they move in parallel to the ego's path, instead of its predicted path.
This design arises from that the predicted path of objects is not accurate enough to use the path modifications (at least currently).
Furthermore, the output drivable area shape is designed as a rectangular cutout along the ego's path to make the computation scalar rather than planar.
