Then, we describe the logic to generate the drivable areas against pedestrians to be avoided.
Objects of this type are considered to have priority right of way over the ego's vehicle while ensuring a minimum safety of the ego's vehicle.
In other words, the module assigns a drivable area to an obstacle with a specific margin based on the predicted paths with specific confidences for a specific time interval, as shown in the following figure.

Apart from polygons for objects, the module also generates another polygon to ensure the ego's safety, i.e., to avoid abrupt steering or significant changes from the path.
This is similar to avoidance against the vehicles and takes precedence over keeping a safe distance from the object to be avoided.
As a result, as shown in the figure below, the polygons around the objects reduced by the secured polygon of the ego are subtracted from the ego's drivable area.
