To decide whether to avoid an object, both the predicted path and the state (pose and twist) of each object are used.
The type of objects the user wants this module to avoid is also required.
Using this information, the module decides to _avoid_ objects that _obstruct the ego's passage_ and _can be avoided_.

The definition of _obstruct the ego's passage_ is implemented as the object that collides within seconds.
The other, _can be avoided_ denotes whether it can be avoided without risk to the passengers or the other vehicles.
For this purpose, the module judges whether the obstacle can be avoided with satisfying the constraints of lateral acceleration and lateral jerk.
For example, the module decides not to avoid an object that is too close or fast in the lateral direction.
