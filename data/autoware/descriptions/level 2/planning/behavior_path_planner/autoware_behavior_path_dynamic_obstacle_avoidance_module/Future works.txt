Currently, the path shifting length is limited to 0.5 meters or less by `drivable_area_generation.max_lat_offset_to_avoid`.
This is caused by the lack of functionality to work with other modules and the structure of the planning component.
Due to this issue, this module can only handle situations where a small avoidance width is sufficient.
This issue is the most significant for this module.
In addition, the ability of this module to extend the drivable area as needed is also required.
