- **Multiple approvals required**: When the planned path includes a backward driving, multiple approvals are needed before starting the reverse and again before restarting forward movement. Before initiating forward movement, the system conducts safety checks against dynamic obstacles. If a detection is detected, approval for departure is necessary.

This differentiation ensures that the vehicle operates safely by requiring human intervention in manual mode(`enable_rtc` is true) at critical junctures and incorporating automatic safety checks in both modes to prevent unsafe operations in the presence of dynamic obstacles.
