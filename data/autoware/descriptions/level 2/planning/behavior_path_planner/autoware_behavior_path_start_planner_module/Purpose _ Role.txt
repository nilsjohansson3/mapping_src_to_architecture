This module generates and plans a path for safely merging from the shoulder lane or side of road lane into the center of the road lane.

Specifically, it includes the following features:

- Plan the path to automatically start from the shoulder lane or side of road lane to center of road lane.
- When parked vehicles are present on the shoulder lane, the module generates a path that allows for starting with a gap of a specified margin.
- If a collision with other traffic participants is detected while traveling on the generated path, it will stop as much as possible.
