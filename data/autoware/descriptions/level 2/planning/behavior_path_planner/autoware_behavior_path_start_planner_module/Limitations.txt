Here are some notable limitations:

- If parked vehicles exist in front of, behind, or on both sides of the shoulder, and it's not possible to maintain a specified distance from them, a stopping path will be generated, leading to a potential deadlock.
- In the default settings of the behavior_path_planner, an avoidance module operates in a later stage and attempts to avoid objects. However, it is not guaranteed that the start_planner module will output a path that can successfully navigate around obstacles. This means that if an unavoidable path is generated, it could result in a deadlock.
- The performance of safety check relies on the accuracy of the predicted paths generated by the map_based_prediction node. It's important to note that, currently, predicted paths that consider acceleration are not generated, and paths for low-speed objects may not be accurately produced, which requires caution.
- Given the current specifications of the rule-based algorithms, there is a trade-off between the safety of a path and its naturalness to humans. While it's possible to adjust parameters to manage this trade-off, improvements are necessary to better reconcile these aspects.
