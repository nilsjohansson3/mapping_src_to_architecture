The `StartPlannerModule` is designed to initiate its execution based on specific criteria evaluated by the `isExecutionRequested` function. The module will **not** start under the following conditions:

1. **Start pose on the middle of the road**: The module will not initiate if the start pose of the vehicle is determined to be in the middle of the road. This ensures the planner starts from a roadside position.

2. **Vehicle is far from start position**: If the vehicle is far from the start position, the module will not execute. This prevents redundant execution when the new goal is given.

3. **Vehicle reached goal**: The module will not start if the vehicle has already reached its goal position, avoiding unnecessary execution when the destination is attained.

4. **Vehicle in motion**: If the vehicle is still moving, the module will defer starting. This ensures that planning occurs from a stable, stationary state for safety.

5. **Goal behind in same route segment**: The module will not initiate if the goal position is behind the ego vehicle within the same route segment. This condition is checked to avoid complications with planning routes that require the vehicle to move backward on its current path, which is currently not supported.
