The ego vehicle is considered stuck if it is stopped and meets any of the following conditions:

- There is an obstacle in front of the current lane
- The ego vehicle is at the end of the current lane

In this case, the safety check for lane change is relaxed compared to normal times.
Please refer to the 'stuck' section under the 'Collision checks during lane change' for more details.
The function to stop by keeping a margin against forward obstacle in the previous section is being performed to achieve this feature.
