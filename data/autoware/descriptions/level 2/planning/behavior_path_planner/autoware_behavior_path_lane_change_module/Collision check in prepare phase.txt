The ego vehicle may need to secure ample inter-vehicle distance ahead of the target vehicle before attempting a lane change. The flag `enable_collision_check_at_prepare_phase` can be enabled to gain this behavior. The following image illustrates the differences between the `false` and `true` cases.

The parameter `prepare_phase_ignore_target_speed_thresh` can be configured to ignore the prepare phase collision check for targets whose speeds are less than a specific threshold, such as stationary or very slow-moving objects.
