The lane-changing phase consist of the shifted path that moves ego from current lane to the target lane. Total distance of lane-changing phase is as follows. Note that during the lane changing phase, the ego vehicle travels at a constant speed.

```C++
lane_change_prepare_velocity = std::max(current_speed + deceleration * lane_change_prepare_duration, minimum_lane_changing_velocity)
lane_changing_distance = lane_change_prepare_velocity * lane_changing_duration
```

The `backward_length_buffer_for_end_of_lane` is added to allow some window for any possible delay, such as control or mechanical delay during brake lag.
