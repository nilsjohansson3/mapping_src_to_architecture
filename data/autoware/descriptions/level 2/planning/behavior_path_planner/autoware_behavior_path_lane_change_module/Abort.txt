Assume the ego vehicle has already departed from the current lane. In that case, it is dangerous to cancel the path, and it will cause the ego vehicle to change the heading direction abruptly. In this case, planning a trajectory that allows the ego vehicle to return to the current path while minimizing the heading changes is necessary. In this case, the lane change module will generate an abort path. The following images show an example of the abort path. Do note that the function DOESN'T GUARANTEE a safe abort process, as it didn't check the presence of the surrounding objects and/or their reactions. The function can be enable manually by setting both `enable_on_prepare_phase` and `enable_on_lane_changing_phase` to `true`. The parameter `max_lateral_jerk` need to be set to a high value in order for it to work.
