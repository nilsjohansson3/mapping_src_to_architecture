In addition to sampling longitudinal acceleration, we also sample lane change paths by adjusting the value of lateral acceleration. Since lateral acceleration influences the duration of a lane change, a lower lateral acceleration value results in a longer lane change path, while a higher lateral acceleration value leads to a shorter lane change path. This allows the lane change module to generate a shorter lane change path by increasing the lateral acceleration when there is limited space for the lane change.

The maximum and minimum lateral accelerations are defined in the lane change parameter file as a map. The range of lateral acceleration is determined for each velocity by linearly interpolating the values in the map. Let's assume we have the following map

| Ego Velocity | Minimum lateral acceleration | Maximum lateral acceleration |
| :----------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| 0.0          | 0.2                          | 0.3                          |
| 2.0          | 0.2                          | 0.4                          |
| 4.0          | 0.3                          | 0.4                          |
| 6.0          | 0.3                          | 0.5                          |

In this case, when the current velocity of the ego vehicle is 3.0, the minimum and maximum lateral accelerations are 0.25 and 0.4 respectively. These values are obtained by linearly interpolating the second and third rows of the map, which provide the minimum and maximum lateral acceleration values.

Within this range, we sample the lateral acceleration for the ego vehicle. Similar to the method used for sampling longitudinal acceleration, the resolution of lateral acceleration (lateral_acceleration_resolution) is determined by the following:

```C++
lateral_acceleration_resolution = (maximum_lateral_acceleration - minimum_lateral_acceleration) / lateral_acceleration_sampling_num
```
