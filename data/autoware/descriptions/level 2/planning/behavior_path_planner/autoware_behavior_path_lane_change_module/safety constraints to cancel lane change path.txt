| :-------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `safety_check.cancel.expected_front_deceleration`         | [m/s^2] | double | The front object's maximum deceleration when the front vehicle perform sudden braking. (\*1)                                                                   | -1.0          |
| `safety_check.cancel.expected_rear_deceleration`          | [m/s^2] | double | The rear object's maximum deceleration when the rear vehicle perform sudden braking. (\*1)                                                                     | -2.0          |
| `safety_check.cancel.rear_vehicle_reaction_time`          | [s]     | double | The reaction time of the rear vehicle driver which starts from the driver noticing the sudden braking of the front vehicle until the driver step on the brake. | 1.5           |
| `safety_check.cancel.rear_vehicle_safety_time_margin`     | [s]     | double | The time buffer for the rear vehicle to come into complete stop when its driver perform sudden braking.                                                        | 0.8           |
| `safety_check.cancel.lateral_distance_max_threshold`      | [m]     | double | The lateral distance threshold that is used to determine whether lateral distance between two object is enough and whether lane change is safe.                | 1.0           |
| `safety_check.cancel.longitudinal_distance_min_threshold` | [m]     | double | The longitudinal distance threshold that is used to determine whether longitudinal distance between two object is enough and whether lane change is safe.      | 2.5           |
| `safety_check.cancel.longitudinal_velocity_delta_time`    | [m]     | double | The time multiplier that is used to compute the actual gap between vehicle at each predicted points (not RSS distance)                                         | 0.6           |
