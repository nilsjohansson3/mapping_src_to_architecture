In Autoware, point cloud data from each LiDAR sensor undergoes preprocessing in the sensing pipeline before being input
into the perception pipeline. The preprocessing stages are illustrated in the diagram below:

Each stage in the pipeline incurs a processing delay. Mostly, we've used `ros2 topic delay /topic_name` to measure
the time between the message header and the current time. This approach works well for small-sized messages. However,
when dealing with large point cloud messages, this method introduces an additional delay. This is primarily because
accessing these large point cloud messages externally impacts the pipeline's performance.

Our sensing/perception nodes are designed to run within composable node containers, leveraging intra-process
communication. External subscriptions to these messages (like using ros2 topic delay or rviz2) impose extra delays and
can even slow down the pipeline by subscribing externally. Therefore, these measurements will not be accurate.

To mitigate this issue, we've adopted a method where each node in the pipeline reports its pipeline latency time.
This approach ensures the integrity of intra-process communication and provides a more accurate measure of delays in the
pipeline.
