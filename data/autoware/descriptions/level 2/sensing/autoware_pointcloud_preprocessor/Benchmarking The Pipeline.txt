The nodes within the pipeline report the pipeline latency time, indicating the duration from the sensor driver's pointcloud
output to the node's output. This data is crucial for assessing the pipeline's health and efficiency.

When running Autoware, you can monitor the pipeline latency times for each node in the pipeline by subscribing to the
following ROS 2 topics:

- `/sensing/lidar/LidarX/crop_box_filter_self/debug/pipeline_latency_ms`
- `/sensing/lidar/LidarX/crop_box_filter_mirror/debug/pipeline_latency_ms`
- `/sensing/lidar/LidarX/distortion_corrector/debug/pipeline_latency_ms`
- `/sensing/lidar/LidarX/ring_outlier_filter/debug/pipeline_latency_ms`
- `/sensing/lidar/concatenate_data_synchronizer/debug/sensing/lidar/LidarX/pointcloud/pipeline_latency_ms`

These topics provide the pipeline latency times, giving insights into the delays at various stages of the pipeline
from the sensor output of LidarX to each subsequent node.
