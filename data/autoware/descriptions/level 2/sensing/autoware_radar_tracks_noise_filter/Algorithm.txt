The core algorithm of this package is `RadarTrackCrossingNoiseFilterNode::isNoise()` function.
See the function and the parameters for details.

- Y-axis threshold

Radar can detect x-axis velocity as doppler velocity, but cannot detect y-axis velocity.
Some radar can estimate y-axis velocity inside the device, but it sometimes lack precision.
In y-axis threshold filter, if y-axis velocity of RadarTrack is more than `velocity_y_threshold`, it treats as noise objects.
