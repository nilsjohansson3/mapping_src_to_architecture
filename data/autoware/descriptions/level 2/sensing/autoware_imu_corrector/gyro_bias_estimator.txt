`gyro_bias_validator` is a node that validates the bias of the gyroscope. It subscribes to the `sensor_msgs::msg::Imu` topic and validate if the bias of the gyroscope is within the specified range.

Note that the node calculates bias from the gyroscope data by averaging the data only when the vehicle is stopped.
