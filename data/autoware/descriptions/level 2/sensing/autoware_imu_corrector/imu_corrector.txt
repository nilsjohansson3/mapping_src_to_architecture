`imu_corrector_node` is a node that correct imu data.

1. Correct yaw rate offset $b$ by reading the parameter.
2. Correct yaw rate standard deviation $\sigma$ by reading the parameter.

Mathematically, we assume the following equation:

$$
\tilde{\omega}(t) = \omega(t) + b(t) + n(t)
$$

where $\tilde{\omega}$ denotes observed angular velocity, $\omega$ denotes true angular velocity, $b$ denotes an offset, and $n$ denotes a gaussian noise.
We also assume that $n\sim\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$.
